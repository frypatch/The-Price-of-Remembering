# CHAPTER 50

## The Proper Way  

When I stepped through the jagged wound in the Waystone Inn’s wall, dragging it back into Temerant, the air outside clung to me. Sharp, cold, unnatural. Bast and Chronicler stood waiting, their faces full of questions.  

Bast broke the silence first, his voice tight. “Kvothe—”  

I held up my ruined hand to stop him. The fresh wound throbbed, a steady pulse in time with my heart. “Later,” I said with a finality that left no room for argument. “There’ll be time enough for questions later. But now, there’s this.”

I shrugged the heavy burlap sack higher onto my shoulder, feeling its damp weight shift slightly. The smell had settled in—iron and something darker, something cloying that turned in your stomach like sour milk.

Bast’s sharp eyes tracked it, his mouth uncertain. “Do I dare ask what that is?” he asked, one brow curving upward.

“You’ll see soon enough,” I said, brushing past him before my gaze shifted purposefully to Chronicler.

“Where are we headed?” the scribe asked, his voice calm but tight, like a man taking great care not to show fear.

“Martin’s,” I said simply, already moving forward, my strides purposeful. Breath came short as the strain of the sack wore on me. But I welcomed it. It felt proper. Necessary.

“Crazy Martin,” Bast muttered behind me, half to himself. “Oh, joy.”

The moon hung low by the time we reached Martin’s hovel, its pale light bleaching the tree line like dead bone. I knocked three sharp times and waited.  

The door opened just enough to show a sliver of Martin’s face. “Tehlu’s teeth, do you know what hour it is—” His voice cut off as his eyes landed on me. Or rather, on the sack. He opened the door wider, his sharp gaze flicking from the sack to my face.  

“Is that what I think it is?” he asked, his voice flat.  

“It is,” I said, pushing past him into the hovel. The sack’s weight seemed to follow me, heavier now than when I’d first shouldered it. “Is everything ready?”  

Martin snorted as he bolted the door behind us. “For over a year now. But I’d hoped I’d never have to see you with… that.”  

The space inside was cramped and dark, the air thick with woodsmoke and something bitter underneath it. Martin moved quickly, lighting lanterns and working his way to the center of the room. He knelt and rolled back a thick, threadbare rug, revealing two large wooden trapdoors set flush with the floor.  

“Stand back,” he said curtly, grabbing an iron gaff from the wall. He hooked it into an iron ring and heaved. The trapdoors groaned as they opened, revealing the pit below.  

Torchlight flickered across the scene: the pit was deep, the bottom layered with ash, elm, and rowan. At its center sat the wheel.  

The iron looked dull, heavy, and worn—but something about the way it rested gave it weight beyond its materials, as though the thing itself were waiting.  

Chronicler shifted uneasily, his fingers twitching as if searching for his pen. Bast’s lips pressed into a thin line, his tail curling and flicking in nervous arcs.  

Martin folded his arms, his tone dry. “I assume you remember how this works?”  

I answered by stepping forward and resting the sack on the floor with slow deliberation. Its weight sagged against the boards, leaking silence into the room.  

Chronicler spoke first, his voice low, solemn. “Let me tell you what to do.”  

Bast followed, his tone softer, the words laced with reluctant familiarity. “Dig a pit that’s ten by two.”  

I finished, my voice steady as I stared into the pit. The words came easy, roots grown deep. “Ash and elm and rowan, too.”  

For a moment, the hovel seemed smaller, the air too thick, the space too tight. The pit below carried its own kind of silence—a waiting void of breath and darkness.  

“Get me the ladder,” I said.
