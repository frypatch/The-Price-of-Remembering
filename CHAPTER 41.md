# CHAPTER 41

## Threadbare and Boundless  

We didn’t run so much as stagger from the battle. The screams of the Chandrian and the thunder of Tehlu’s angels tore holes in the night behind us, but we kept moving, one agonizing step after another. Denna clutched her side, her hand slick with blood, and the dusk-light of her face grew paler with every uneven stride. My mouth was dry. My legs ached. My mind replayed the scene again and again: the flash of Cinder’s blade, Denna’s knife buried in his neck. Her gasp when he struck her.  

Down the craggy mountain slopes we fled, boots scraping against loose stone, the cold air burning our lungs. When the first dim flickers of sunlight appeared on the horizon, we reached the foothills, a sparse scattering of ironwood and desert willow. Finally, we stopped, collapsing into the shadows of the thickets. I peeled off my shirt, which was damp with sweat, and wiped the blood clear from my hands. Then I turned to Denna.  

"I'm fine," she muttered, though she couldn’t lift her head.  

"No, you’re not." My voice was harsher than I intended.  

The rising sun laid plain what darkness had concealed. The wound in her stomach was red and wet, the skin around it swollen. My heart clenched as I recognized the cruelty of the injury: a blow meant to kill slowly. A wound intended to make the victim suffer as much from despair as pain. I’d seen enough in the Medica to know the signs, to understand the odds. I swallowed hard, shoving those thoughts aside.  

“You’re lucky I’m desperate and clever,” I said, trying to force a quip through the tightening of my throat.  

Denna gave a breathless laugh that sounded more like a cough.  

I ripped the last clean strip of fabric from my now-tattered shirt and pressed it tightly against her wound. Then, with shaking fingers, I pulled at the edge of my shaed. The shadow resisted me, stubborn as a mule. It thinned and stretched, trying to snap back into place, but I dug my nails into it, and at last, a thread of darkness unraveled. I used it to stitch Denna’s wound. By the time I was done, my hands ached and sweat dripped off my nose into the dirt.  

Denna’s faint smile had faded, replaced by a pale grim line. “That looks like something out of a nightmare,” she said, staring at my work.  

“It’s keeping you alive,” I said, more sharply than I meant. “Let’s move. We need water.”  

***  

The desert stretched before us, an endless, sun-scorched expanse. I held the shaed above us to shield Denna from the worst of the heat, but the unstitched strand had frayed something vital in its magic. The edges of the shadow-borne cloak began to shred and tremble in the dry wind. It unraveled slowly—a thread curling away here, a piece of darkness tearing loose there—until all that remained was a single scrap the size of my hand.  

I stared at it for a long moment and then tucked it gently into my pocket. Denna stirred weakly beside me.  

“Bad luck?” she asked, her voice thin.  

“For the shaed, maybe.” I gestured toward the endless sand. “We’ve still got worse to worry about.”  

We walked for hours, and Denna leaned against me more and more. When she faltered, I carried her, ignoring the fire burning in my legs and back. I counted my breaths. I counted my steps. I told myself if I reached one hundred, I’d let myself think of water. Of shade. Of sleep.  

On the second day, I nearly wept at the sight of a figure far ahead, shimmering in the heat haze. At first, I thought it was a mirage, a cruel trick of the desert. But the closer we came, the sharper the silhouette became: a wide-brimmed hat, a pack laden with wares, and the unmistakable hunch of a Tinker trudging across the dunes. I quickened my pace, though my every muscle screamed in protest.  

The Tinker turned, and his face brightened when he saw us. "Ho there! Stragglers in the sands!"  

By the time we reached him, Denna was barely conscious. “Water,” I croaked.  

He handed me a leather skin with a look of pity. I poured some into Denna's mouth before taking a swig myself. It tasted of sweat and old leather, but in that moment, I swore it to be more precious than wine.  

“I have little else to spare,” the Tinker said, gesturing to his pack. “A bit of hard bread. Some cloth to wrap your faces. Not much. The desert takes more than it gives.”  

“We’ll take anything you can offer," I said, brushing the sand from my hand as I reached for the pouch at my belt. It wasn’t much: a few iron drabs, a chipped ring, a broken gearwheel I’d never finished repairing.  

The Tinker shook his head. His eyes fell to Denna’s hand, where her slim silver ring glittered faintly. She must have realized it too, because she spoke just as I opened my mouth to argue.  

“Take it,” she whispered firmly, twisting the ring from her finger. “It’s fine. It was never… never mine to begin with.”  

The Tinker hesitated, then nodded solemnly and handed over the supplies. I tried not to look at Denna as she leaned back against me, as if no longer holding the ring had drained something out of her.  

"Northwest from here," the Tinker said, squinting against the horizon. "Follow the dunes until they dip. You'll find a tribe of Tahl in half a day if your legs hold out."  

I nodded and helped Denna to her feet.  

***  

We did not find the Tahl tribe in half a day, nor in two. By the third, the last of the bread was gone, and not a drop remained in the skin. Denna grew too weak to walk at all. Her breathing slowed, her murmurs lost the shimmer of her usual wit, and worst of all, a sweet, cloying scent began to rise from her wound.  

I carried her as far as I could, my legs trembling with each step. My world shrank to the sensation of the burning sun overhead and Denna’s weight against my chest. I spoke to her to pass the time, half to distract her and half to keep myself from breaking apart entirely. “We’ll be fine. Just a few more miles and we’ll come across an oasis. Or someone will find us. I’ll trade them… well, I haven’t much left, but I’ll think of something. You know me. Clever, remember?”  

Denna didn’t reply.  

I stumbled, my knees buckling beneath me. The sand gave way as I fell, my arms still wrapped around her. I lay there, tasting dust on my tongue. Weak and spent, I felt the weight of hopelessness drag across my chest, heavier than Denna had been.  

Thin clouds shifted lazily above me, pale and distant—out of reach.
