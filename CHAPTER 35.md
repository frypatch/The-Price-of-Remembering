# CHAPTER 35

## The Price of Loyalty  

The mangonel’s arm creaked, ropes groaning as they drew back the heavy stone for another deadly blow. I leaned against the frozen wall, my shoulder aflame, my breaths shallow. Every movement felt like shards of glass grinding against bone. I wanted to act, to move, but my body betrayed me, shaking with weakness and exhaustion.  

And then the horns came.  

The sound cut sharp over the battlefield, louder and more terrible than the hiss of violence below. I twisted toward the arrow slit, the motion wrenching at my wound. Beneath me, the battlefield churned like a broken tide. Fascino’s forces—slick with blood and still jeering in their grim work—turned sharply at the sound.  

Knights surged forward, their armor flashing in sapphire and ivory. Their banners flew, one over the other. The first, House Calanthis, bore red and gold, trampled in mud and tarnished with soot. But the second banner made my stomach twist in place: sapphire and silver, the seal of the Maer Alveron.  

I watched as the Maer’s forces swept through Fascino’s ranks with ruthless precision. Dagon, Alveron’s dark-eyed captain, swung his saber cleanly, severing Fascino’s head from his body in a single arc. Baron Jakis was next, fleeing on foot with blood on his hands and panic in his eyes. The Maer himself bore down on him with the force of inevitability. His voice boomed, stripped of mercy.  

“You thought to poison me? You thought *that* would be enough?”  

Jakis didn’t die swiftly.  

A pressure settled on the room in the silence that followed. "Raise the gate!" Roderick’s voice cracked, strained with brittle hope. His relief felt sharp and wrong, and when the portcullis staggered upward, I couldn’t stop the words from spilling from my mouth.  

“Wait—”  

No one listened.  

The Maer’s forces entered the courtyard like a steel tide. Alveron climbed down from his steed, his knights fanning out behind him as he walked toward the tower. Each step the man took echoed with an authority we had no choice but to obey.  

The boots came first, climbing the stairs in a slow, steady rhythm.  

***

Alveron entered with measured purpose, his knights flowing around him until they filled every shadow in the room. The Maer’s expression was cool as an autumn lake. Whatever kindness I had ever seen in his sharp features was gone as though it had never existed. He carried no pretense of warmth. He didn’t need to.  

Roderick stumbled forward, hand extended, the glinting silver of his house seal catching the faint light. “Lerand,” he started, his voice forcefully bright. “You came. You saved me. I knew—”  

Alveron stopped him mid-word. “No.”  

The word was sharp, and it carried enough weight to stop Roderick in his tracks. “I didn’t come for you,” the Maer added, quiet but certain.  

The silence of the room pressed inward, broken only by a faint creak of leather as Alveron unsheathed his sword. Roderick froze. He had seen his death. The streak of crimson that followed was almost an afterthought—a quiet bloom spreading across Roderick’s throat, his crown rolling away as though eager to depart its master’s fallen head.  

Auri screamed and darted forward, desperate and trembling.  

“No!” The shout came from Sim.  

I caught Auri’s wrist first, pulling her back with shaking fingers as she struggled against me. Sim had stepped forward, his face pale but his jaw clenched in anguish. He fumbled for a weapon and caught up a discarded sword, its hilt awkward in his hands.  

“For all your cleverness,” Alveron said, turning his attention to me, “you thought to bind yourself to this sinking wreck of a king? Truly, did you think yourself immune to reaping what you’ve sown?”  

The nod he gave Dagon was slight. The captain lunged. I raised my hand instinctively and called the Name of Fire, expecting resistance. What came was unshackled fury, both imperfect and wild. The torrent struck Dagon square in the chest, fire wreathing his armor, blistering his face into something monstrous. His screams were barely human.  

But the act had cost me. I crumpled back against the wall, breathing in a horrible stagger. Dagon, though burned, did not fall.  

***

Sim stepped into the gap before I could move.  

“Stay back!” Sim roared, his voice startlingly loud. The knights hesitated. And for a moment, I thought he might find himself frozen too. Then he shifted his feet, a sudden surety in how his body moved.  

The Name settled in him. It didn’t crack like lightning, nor did it whisper. But something in the way he gripped the borrowed blade changed, as though he had always known it.  

Iron.  

His focus shifted, sharpening into unrelenting precision. Sim’s first strike came faster than I’d ever thought him capable, bending his opponent’s blade with weight that didn’t feel like his own strength. He stepped inside the swing, striking with the assurance of someone guided by more than instinct.  

The knights faltered under Sim’s fury, iron bending to his will. He cut through one—then another—but each step forward stole the softness from Sim’s face. With each strike, his shoulders hunched, and his limbs trembled, his body wearing the cost of what his mind demanded.  

Wil moved to join him, his heavy axe cleaving into one of the knights that came too close. “Sim!” Wil barked. “Fall back!”  

Sim didn’t respond.  

I called to him, but it was already too late. In his focus, Sim hadn’t spotted the knight flanking from his blind side. A blade cut through his torso with a sick, wet sound.  

Wil roared, charging forward and dropping two with reckless strength, but too many blades turned on him. Steel pierced him from every direction, and his body fell with the heavy finality of stone.  

Sim collapsed first. He turned wide, panic-filled eyes toward me, and his lips moved soundlessly. Whatever he tried to say crossed into nothingness before it reached me.  

***

Heat rushed through me. A cold, sharp heat, like a blade dragged over living nerve.  

I called the wind by name, but it wasn’t the wind I had summoned before. This Wind came raw and jagged and answered with violent hunger.  

It tore through the room, blades of air cutting through Alveron’s knights as though they were paper. Dagon staggered within it, his burned body refusing to fall even as it ripped at what little strength he had.  

The storm ebbed only as I stumbled over my own legs. My Alar cracked, broken under its own strain. I didn’t see Dagon lunge until it was too late. His saber drove through my chest. Another soundless gasp became all that was left of me.  

Auri’s voice called faintly in my ear: “Kvothe, live. Please.”  

And then the Wind was all that remained as I fell.
