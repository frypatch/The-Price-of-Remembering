# CHAPTER 47.

## THE RECKONING.

THE UNDERTHING WAS a place of stone and silence and slow water. It was not a place for Bast.  

He was young, bright as copper jots, and quick as spilled mercury. He deserved what I had once known, that precious time of carefree peace. He belonged in mornings heavy with promise and possibility. He should have afternoons caught in tangled chords and wild laughter, evenings thick with honey-gold light and the company of those whose fire matched his own. Not this patient darkness that wrapped around us like an old cloak. Every day I told him this. Every day I reminded him he was free to seek that life.  

He would go topside, following Auri’s secret paths like a cat exploring familiar territory. But he always came back. Always returned to sit in the darkness with me, when he could have been dancing in the light.  

I knew the shape of his worry. It sat between us like a third person at our table, silent and watchful. He would catch me staring at nothing, my hands gone still over whatever task I’d set them to. He would see me press my remaining fingers against my palm, counting what was left, remembering what was lost. In those moments his smile would falter, just for a heartbeat, before blazing back twice as bright.  

“You could leave,” I would say.  

“I could dance on moonbeams,” he would answer. “I could kiss a duchess and steal her diamonds. I could do many things.”  

And that would be the end of it, until the next time.  

### * * *  

It was a Hepten morning when everything changed. Bast had gone topside as he often did, following the secret paths Auri had shown him. The way he climbed through grates and narrow spaces reminded me of a cat, all liquid grace and casual certainty. He never stayed away long, an hour or two at most, before his worry drew him back. But even those brief escapes brought him back changed, carrying stories and gossip, his words tumbling over each other like puppies at play.  

This time he returned too soon.  

I heard his footsteps before I saw him. Wrong. All wrong. The usual bounce was missing, replaced by something heavier.  

I felt myself sinking. These past days, I had begun to find my way back to something like myself. Not whole, never that, but climbing slowly toward the light. Now, with each of Bast’s heavy steps, I felt that fragile progress crumbling. The darkness I’d been holding at arm’s length rushed back in like water through a broken dam.  

“Reshi.” The word came out wrong.  

I looked up from the bowl of porridge I’d been letting grow cold. “You look like a man who’s trying to swallow bad news.”  

He pulled something from his pocket. Paper. Crumpled and worn at the edges. He set it on the table between us with the kind of care usually reserved for things that might explode.  

I smoothed it flat. The ink was cheap and the drawing was worse, but there was no mistaking the face that stared back at me. My face, more or less, caught in harsh black lines.  

> KVOTHE KINGKILLER, SON OF ARLIDEN. 100 MARKS.  

“A hundred marks.” I pushed the paper away with one finger. “I’m almost insulted. I’d have thought I was worth at least twice that.”  

“There’s more.” Bast’s voice had gone low. “Ambrose is here. In the city. He’s been making speeches in the squares, telling anyone who’ll listen that you killed the king. That you’re hiding somewhere close. That you’ve stolen Princess Ariel from him.”  

“Ariel?” The little porridge I had ate turned to stone. “Stolen?”  

“He says she belongs to him. Says he’ll drag you through the streets and take her back to Renere where she belongs.”  

“Take me to him.” I was on my feet before the words finished leaving my mouth, the chair clattering behind me.  

“Reshi, wait. Think about this.”  

But I was already moving. Not thinking. Not planning. The Lethani, the University’s laws, the Iron Law, all the wisdom of my years fell away. There was only motion. Only the terrible certainty that comes when thought stops and instinct takes the reins.  

“Take me to him now.” My voice was calm as millpond water. As still as the moment before lightning strikes.  

### * * *  

Ambrose stood in the square by the fountain. The same fountain where I’d first called the wind, all those years ago. The same stones where I’d broken his arm and earned his hatred. The wheel turns and we return to our beginnings, carrying all our endings with us.  

His men flanked him like a wall of sharp edges and bright steel. Eight of them. Maybe ten. It didn’t matter. Numbers had stopped mattering to me a long time ago.  

He was in the middle of some story when I stepped into view. His voice carried across the square, rich with the particular poison that comes from old money and older grudges. Even from across the courtyard, I could see his rings catching the light. Could see that ridiculous hat he’d taken to wearing.  

“I hear you’ve been looking for me,” I called.  

The square went quiet. Not the comfortable quiet of a pause in conversation, but the terrible quiet that comes before storms. Before avalanches. Before the world changes.  

Ambrose turned, and for just a moment, I saw surprise flicker across his face. Then his mouth curved into that familiar sneer.  

“The Ruh bastard shows himself at last.” His voice filled the square, playing to the crowd that had begun to gather. “Kvothe the Arcane. Murderer of kings. Thief of virtue.”  

“I was there when the king died,” I said, my voice carrying without effort. “But I didn’t kill him. We both know who holds that particular honor.”  

“Liar!” The word cracked like a whip. “Nothing is ever your fault, is it? Your blood is filth. Your very existence is a stain.”  

He reached into his pocket and my heart stuttered. A vial. Small and dark and familiar. He held it up so the light caught the liquid inside. Blood. My blood.  

The crowd drew back, sensing something they couldn’t name. The air grew thick and strange.  

“Your Copperhawk was careless,” Ambrose said, savoring each word. “Left this behind when they snatched her up.”  

“Don’t.”  

One word. Firm as steel. Heavy as mountains.  

Ambrose laughed. It was an ugly sound, like glass breaking in a beautiful room. “Or what? You’ll kill me? Add another corpse to your collection? Once I’m done with you, I’ll take Ariel wherever I please. Renere will be delighted to see her again, I’m certain. And you? I’ll leave your body in pieces, your head on a spike for all to see.”  

He opened the vial. Dipped his fingers in my blood. Spoke the first words of binding.  

And nothing happened.  

No. That’s not quite right. Something happened. Ambrose felt it. I could see it in the way his face changed, the way his fingers trembled as he tried again. He pushed against me with all the sympathy he could muster, and it was like a child pushing against a cart.  

“Bind him!” His voice cracked on the command. “Bind him now!”  

His men moved forward. Good men, probably. Just following orders. Just doing their job. They had rope and iron and all the things men use to hold other men.  

I raised my hand. Spoke a word.  

The wind answered.  

It didn’t come gently. It didn’t whisper or dance or play. It came like the scream of every storm that ever was. The fountain cracked down the middle, water erupting skyward in a geyser that turned to mist. The cobblestones beneath our feet groaned and split. Ambrose’s men flew backward like leaves before a hurricane.  

The crowd scattered, screaming.  

But Ambrose stayed where he was. Not because he was brave. Because I held him there. Because the wind that threw everyone else away left him untouched, alone in a circle of stillness while chaos raged around us.  

“Stop.” His voice was small now. Young. Like the boy he’d been when we first met, before money and malice had carved him into the shape he wore. “Please.”  

“You threatened her.” Each word fell like a stone into still water, sending ripples through the air. “You came here with your blood magic and your hired swords and you threatened one of the only people in this world who still matter to me.”  

I took a step forward. The ground cracked beneath my foot.  

“I know you, Ambrose.” Another step. Another crack spreading like a spider’s web. “I know you better than you know yourself. I know the shape of your fear. The weight of your father’s hand. The taste of every humiliation you’ve swallowed and turned into cruelty.”  

He was shaking now. His fine clothes suddenly seeming a poor thing.  

“Kvothe, I’m sorry,” he pleaded.  

“No,” I said. “You’re not.”  

And then I sang his Name.  

It came to me whole and perfect, the way a melody sometimes arrives complete in your mind. Every note of him. Every harmony and discord. The proud boy who’d never been told no. The young man who’d learned that power could make truth whatever he wanted it to be. The hollow place inside him where love should have lived.  

I sang his Name and wove it with the Names of stone and air and water and fire. I sang him into the heart of creation and then I sang him out of it.  

The square exploded.  

Stone turned to sand. Water turned to steam. The very air seemed to tear like fabric. And Ambrose...  

Ambrose became nothing. Less than nothing. An absence where a person used to be.  

### * * *  

The silence that followed was absolute. The kind of silence that comes after lightning, when the world holds its breath and wonders if it’s still alive.  

I stood in the ruined square, my throat burning like I’d swallowed coals. My knees wanted to buckle but I locked them straight. Around me, people stared with ashen faces. In their eyes I saw myself reflected, and I didn’t recognize what looked back.  

There. At the edge of the crowd. Elodin stood like a statue, his face unreadable except for the terrible weight in his eyes. And beside him, Fela. Sweet Fela who’d once smiled at me over a book of pressing leaves. She looked at me with open revulsion, as though she didn’t recognize me at all.  

I wanted to explain. Wanted to tell them about the blood and the threat and the terrible certainty that Auri wouldn’t be safe until Ambrose was gone. But the words turned to ash in my mouth.  

So I did the only thing I could do.  

I ran.  

Behind me, the fountain continued to weep through its new cracks, spelling out a different kind of silence. The silence that comes after endings. The silence that says some things, once broken, can never be made whole.
