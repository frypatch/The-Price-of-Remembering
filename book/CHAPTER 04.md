# CHAPTER 04

## Ears in the Wind  

I hadn’t even knocked twice before Devi opened the door, her sharp eyes catching mine like the glint of sunlight off a polished blade. “Kvothe,” she said, her voice slipping over my name like silk over steel. “Always a delight. Have you come to lose more of your—” she paused, letting her smile sharpen at the edges like scissors, “—rare and celebrated dignity? Or are we bargaining in blood again?”  

“Neither,” I said with mock indignation, stepping over the threshold. Her room was an uneasy contradiction: the overwhelming warmth of cinnamon fighting a losing battle with the tang of butchered meat rising from below. Jars of alchemical malice cluttered her shelves, glowing faintly in the low light.  

“Good to know,” she replied, letting her smile fold into something smaller but no less dangerous. “But that means you’ve come to ask me for a favor. Which is so much more fun.”  

“It’s nothing dramatic,” I assured her, holding my hands up as if to show I was unarmed. “I just—well, call it a thought experiment. I’ve noticed certain types of sigaldry reacting strangely when improperly prepared.”  

Her brow sharpened. “Strangely? How?”  

I hesitated, threading just enough truth into my answer to keep her hooked. “It’s… subtle. Faint variations, almost invisible in the etching process. But I think a specific alchemical reaction might be able to highlight them.” I paused, casting a rueful glance around her shelves. “And let’s be honest, you’d have the good sense to brew something far more elegant than anything I could throw together.”  

Devi turned her head, staring at me as if I were a particularly interesting stain on her carpet. “Are you trying to flatter me, Kvothe? Because it’s almost working.”  

“Not flattery,” I said. “Pure respect.”  

She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she drifted toward one of her overloaded shelves, her fingers skimming the tops of vials and jars with the lazy arrogance of someone who already knew exactly where everything was. Finally, she plucked a small golden vial from its place and held it up to the lantern light.  

“This should do it,” she said, handing it to me with the kind of grace that makes you think twice about saying no. “But, of course, the question remains: what will you give me in return?”  

“Money,” I said quickly.  

Her laugh had an edge sharp enough to draw blood. “Money? Really? You’ve been living in your little tower of books too long, Kvothe. I want something more lasting.” She stepped closer, cradling the vial in her palm like it was a living thing. “A blood favor.”  

The air between us tightened. “No.”  

“No?” She tilted her head, all soft danger now. “Are you sure? Because when people come to me with half-truths and flimsy explanations, it’s usually because they’re desperate.”  

“No blood favors.”  

Her smile thinned, but her grip on the vial relaxed as she made to replace it on the shelf. “Well then, best of luck with your subtle experiment—”  

“Fine.” The word spilled out before I could stop it, bitter and heavy. I forced myself to meet her gaze even as my pulse pulled tight in my chest. “A blood favor.”  

Devi’s grin returned, wicked and gleaming. She passed me the vial with both hands, as if offering me a crown of thorns. “The world is infinitely more fun when you let go of rules, Kvothe,” she said, her voice following me out the door.  

I didn’t respond. The vial felt heavier in my pocket than it had any right to be, as if it had taken more than just glass and liquid to make it mine.  

***

The Medica held its breath, the kind of silence that settles like a frost: sharp, brittle, waiting. The lanterns along the walls hissed faintly, their light shivering against polished wood and copper fixtures. Shadows stretched tall and narrow, moving like they had somewhere to be. The place felt uneasy, too quiet, even for a building meant to soothe the wounded.  

“This is ridiculous,” Sim hissed, as close to a shout as a whisper could be. He kept his arms tight against his sides, as if trying to contain the panic threatening to spill over. “Weeks of perfectly good decisions undone by one bad idea and more bad wine. I’m filing a grievance with the world.”  

“Two gallons of wine,” Wil corrected, his voice low and steady. Despite his calm, there was a purpose to his steps, the sharp sound of his boots betraying more effort than ease. “And when Arwyl skins us alive, rest assured, I’ll not say a word in your defense. You first, then him, then me.”  

“No one’s catching us,” I murmured, feigning confidence. My hands curled and uncurled at my sides, itching for work, aching to quiet the restless knot twisting in my chest.  

Ahead of us, nestled unremarkably against the wall, stood the gram’s display case, an unassuming rectangle of glass and brass. But as I approached, my skin prickled, a faint hum settling under my ribs. The air around it felt different, thicker, like the heartbeat of something watching. I crouched over the case, studying its lock: clean lines, utilitarian. Practical and precise. The sort of design that didn’t trust anyone who got too close.  

“You’re sure about this?” Sim muttered, a little too loud. His breath brushed against the back of my neck.  

“Honest answer?” I said, keeping my hands moving as I spoke. I didn’t look up. My voice was quieter than I felt. “Not remotely.”  

The lock gave way with a breath and a whisper, its mechanism yielding without so much as a groan. I lifted the lid, my hand slipping into the case like an afterthought, and the gram came free. It was perfect—symmetrical, polished, a device meant to endure—but wrong all the same. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but once I noticed it, I couldn’t unfeel it.  

I tipped Devi’s vial over the gram, a slow, deliberate tilt, careful as combing snarled strings. The alchemical liquid unfurled like golden smoke, slipping into the etched sigaldry. At first, nothing happened. Then came the reaction: hair-thin lines of jagged brightness creeping outward, sharp and deliberate as frost on a winter window.  

Sim inhaled sharply behind me. I could hear the panic hitching in his breath. “Is that... normal?”  

“No,” I said, though I felt like I was speaking from somewhere else. “It’s not natural. And it’s definitely not grief.”  

I swiped the gram clean, working fast and precise, leaving no trace of our meddling. My fingers moved quicker than my thoughts, already tugging at the edges of the question looming large before me: Who could have done this? And, worse, who would? The craftsmanship was clever. Elegant. Dangerous. Hemme’s name rose first in my mind, thorned and venomous.  

“Done?” Wil whispered.  

“Yes,” I said, fitting the lock back into place with a final click. My hands felt steady, my voice even, but inside, my blood ran far from calm. As we slipped back into the darkened halls of the Medica, a single thought emerged and settled low in my chest, heavy as an iron weight: this had been deliberate, and it wasn’t over.  

***

The night was cold in the courtyard, the air crisp and unforgiving. Moonlight spilled unevenly over the cobblestones, pooling in alcoves where ancient gargoyles studied us with chipped and weathered eyes. The chill bit sharper after what we had seen.  

“This is where it stops,” Sim said at last. His voice was low, his hands buried deep in his pockets. He leaned against the courtyard wall, close but distant, like he desperately needed something solid. I could hear the weariness in his tone, a line stretched too far and trembling. “We don’t push this. We’ve already gone too far.”  

I didn’t respond right away. My fingers toyed with an edge of my cloak, as if they needed to move to keep from curling again into fists. My thoughts twisted, folding and refolding themselves like restless water beneath a frozen bank.  

“Hemme won’t admit to anything,” I said finally, each word sharp and distinct, like I’d spent hours shaping them. “Men like him never do. But I don’t need his confession. I just need him to slip.”  

“To slip,” Sim repeated, flat and unimpressed. His voice, so often warm, felt far away now. He lifted his head to look at me, his eyes searching for something in my face. “And then what? You want him to tumble down the stairs of your cleverness? When has that ever worked?”  

I gave him a faint smile, something quick and dishonest, already moving toward the shadows. “Carefully,” I said. “That’s all it will take. Careful work, and the right ears.”  

“That sounds like a terrible plan,” Wil said darkly, crossing his arms as he leaned against the fountain. “Leave Hemme’s name out of it. If you lose control, I won’t—”  

“Carefully,” I repeated before the rest of his threat could land.  

***

The next afternoon, Brandeur’s measured monotone droned in the lecture hall, filling the air like bad music. He tinkered with theories too dry to spark interest, too dull to linger in memory. Most students stared blankly, their minds somewhere else entirely. I sat near the front, making certain my presence unspooled against his awareness like a snagged thread.  

“Hemme might’ve thought this was clever,” I muttered, just loud enough to be heard. My lips brushed the words softly, almost to myself, though I chose them with care. “It seems so simple. But it’s always the cracks... things slip there first.”  

To his credit, Brandeur’s voice didn’t stumble midsentence, but the brief flicker of his eyes told me what I needed to know. Some threads, even careless ones, pulled tighter than others.  

Hours later, I caught him moving across the cobblestones—his gait sharp and purposeful, his steps cutting through the twilight gloom. He moved toward Hemme’s office. I trailed him at a distance, my own movements quiet, the gargoyle fountain my destination.  

The night deepened around me, my breath curling faint in the cold as I crouched low beside the fountain. I reached out with my Alar, coaxing the overcurious wind to weave its thread, one side toward Hemme’s shuttered office and the other towards Kilvin's. Calling the wind wasn’t force; it was seduction, the kind of charm you coaxed gently, like leading a bird to your open hand. Slowly, I teased softness into firmness, murmuring until it yielded.  

Hemme’s voice rode the current first, sharp and clipped: “It was delicate work, nothing more. Not sabotage. A gentle correction. Something no one should have noticed.”  

Another voice, softer, less distinct: “And Herma?”  

“Herma was old,” Hemme said, and the edge in his voice cut cold. “This didn’t kill him. Time did. I just... moved the clock forward.”  

The wind trembled, slipping free of my words, and with it, the voices dissolved into the night. But I’d heard enough. My teeth clenched against the weight of it. Hemme’s admission was quiet, almost mundane, but it shaped the air around me like a chord struck low and long.  

***

The trial took weeks to wind its way into motion. Weeks where I made myself stay quiet, an unseen Cthaeh easing pieces into place while others bore the weight of suspicion. Kilvin carried the case where I could not, pulling together threads I’d left carefully loose behind me, his calm authority reshaping what I couldn’t touch directly.  

When Hemme finally stood beneath the shadow of the Iron Law, I remained in the gallery, one face in a sea of quiet onlookers. Kilvin testified with grave simplicity, recounting a trail of evidence that pointed unmistakably toward tampering, and toward Hemme. Arwyl followed, dragging the room through his detailed reexamination of Herma’s body. Signs of malfeasance. Tiny, deliberate patterns.  

It wasn’t the confession itself that struck Hemme down. It was the weight of too many threads woven against him, and the smallest fray in his infamous control. The records of materials purchased from the Artificery. The faint patterns in Herma’s decline. His accomplice’s silence. It was inevitable, like a rope drawn tight enough to strangle.  

But even as the trial resolved, I found no satisfaction. Justice wasn’t sharp, not like guilt. It wasn’t clean. It was heavy and dull, something that settled slowly into grief’s hollow weight. I told myself it was enough, though I could not say for sure if I believed it.
