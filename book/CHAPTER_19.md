# CHAPTER 19.

## AMBER AND IVORY.


THE AIR BIT at my skin as we stepped out of the Fae. Sharp, cold, honest. I hadn’t realized how thick the air had been there, thick as amber poured too slowly. Not until it was gone and the world was real again, my limbs made of flesh and bone instead of silk and story.  

Wil and Sim shifted beside me, stretching the way men do after too long in bed. I could see the moment they registered the weight of their own limbs again, the sharpness of the world.  

Then there was Bast.  

Unlike the rest of us, Bast did not move as if shaking off some unseen burden. He simply stood, still and considering. His eyes drifted shut for a moment, his hands loose at his sides. He drew a measured breath, and a small sound escaped him, something almost like amusement, almost like pleasure.  

“Ah,” he murmured. “Now I remember how heavy all this is.”  

I turned to glance at him, unchanged yet entirely different. Here in the mortal world, the shape of him meant something again. Everything about him was a careful act. Even the precise way he breathed carried purpose.  

To his credit, his glamourie was well-woven. It had to be. The Fae do not belong in the mortal world, and the world knows it. Sometimes in whispers. Sometimes in screams. But always in blood. So he crouched, adjusting where the seams of himself blurred too thin. A flick of fingers across his cheekbones, dulling their sharpness. A smooth drag down his side, settling the curve of boots that hid the cloven hooves beneath.  

When he straightened, he rolled his shoulders like a cat settling into an unfamiliar skin.  

Behind us, the greystones stood in their ancient circle, ordinary as any fieldstone now that we had crossed. Just gray pillars in a hillside, half-sunk and patient. You would walk past them a thousand times and never know.  

Sim exhaled slowly. “I still don’t understand how you knew where we’d come out.”  

“Good.” Bast clapped him on the back. “Hold tight to that confusion. It will serve you better than understanding ever could.”  

Sim looked like he didn’t like that answer.  

I didn’t either.  

But, whether or not I understood it, Bast had led us true. And now, we stood in the high hills overlooking Renere.  

“A hungry thing,” Bast murmured, looking down at the vast city threaded with bridges and canals beneath the bent light of the afternoon sun. “You humans do toil in the strangest ways.”  

I caught the faint furrow in his brow as his gaze flickered across the rooftops, to the taut linen lines strung between high windows, bright silks drying in the open air. Searching. Measuring.  

Then, more to himself than us, he mused, “It doesn’t swallow strangers as politely as the Fae, though. That’s something.”  

“Onward to our inevitable doom,” he declared brightly.  

“Fate hasn’t decided that yet,” I muttered.  

Bast tipped his head to the side, much like a hound catching a distant sound. Then he spoke quietly, his voice almost sweet. “Hasn’t it?”  

### * * *  

A gondola would have been easier. The dockmen whistled as we passed, mindful of their poled crafts as they cut lazily through the silver-blue shallows. They gestured toward the open seats, calling out offers any true noble would have acknowledged.  

Sim would have taken one. Then Wil snorted, and Bast turned toward him with a look of pleased curiosity, as if he’d already begun reading Wilem by what he chose to scorn.  

“Afraid of a little walking, Simmon?” Bast asked, in the manner of a man dropping a coin just to watch a beggar decide what dignity is worth.  

Sim straightened immediately. “Obviously not.”  

Wil grunted his approval.  

That was fine with me. A city can’t be known except by its streets. You have to feel it underfoot, listen to how it whets its teeth on laughter.  

Tarbean had leered at me, sprawling and broken, full of jagged edges and cutting smiles. Imre had sung, all light and laughter, wealth and easy kindness.  

Renere?  

Renere did neither.  

The city did not welcome. It did not leer. It swallowed.  

The streets teemed with people, all moving in the tight, choreographed chaos of somewhere built to swallow coin. Silk-sashed bravos walked among hard-eyed merchants. Street performers leapt in wide courtyards, laughter ringing against stone. Everywhere, the sharp scent of cut citrus struggled against the heavier notes of riverwater.  

You could measure a man’s worth by his collar, by the weight of his rings. And you could measure his danger by how easily he walked a city crowded with thieves.  

For the last hour, Bast had prowled the streets at my side, but never where I expected him. He noted rooftops. He pressed palms to market stalls. He fell behind just long enough to poke his head into an alley, then reappeared as if he’d never left. Once I turned to find him gone entirely, then impossibly ahead of us, leaning against a lamppost with the smug satisfaction of someone who has always known where you were going.  

After a time, I realized Wil had noticed, too. He wasn’t watching Bast with suspicion. Not exactly. It was more as if he stood beside a locked door, pressing an ear against the wood and waiting to make out the sounds within, wondering if he might hear a tune or the low breathing of something hungry in the dark.  

Bast caught Wil’s stare. He curved an eyebrow, tilting his head just slightly. His smile was slow and deliberate, unquestionably a challenge.  

“Have a care, dear Wilem. Where I come from, a steady look is half a promise.”  

Wil didn’t slow his pace. He didn’t even blink. “I already have one reckless bastard to look after. Do not need another.”  

That startled real laughter out of Bast, bright and genuine. He breathed out, clearly delighted. “Oh! I take back every unflattering thing I have ever thought about you.”  

“You’ve known me a day,” Wil said dryly.  

Bast shrugged. “Some people inspire insults faster than others.”  

Sim narrowed his eyes at Bast. Then he looked at Wilem. Then at me.  

Finally, he sighed heavily, as if resigning to fate. “Tehlu help me, I think you will get along.”  

Bast grinned as if he’d just won a bet.  

### * * *  

The noise reached us.  

Rhythmic, steady. A pulse in the air, deep and thrumming.  

Up ahead, the street grew crowded. Movement slowed as people pressed together, bodies dense in the narrow space. It was like a clot forming, folk edging away from something uncomfortable. Perhaps it was a sermon. The sort of nonsense any sensible person would rather avoid, with places to be and no time for trouble.  

Wilem frowned. “Now what?”  

Sim hesitated. “They’re just street preachers?”  

I glanced at their hands. Arms crossed tight over thick shoulders. Fists at their sides. These were not men at prayer.  

Wilem had caught it too. “It’s no sermon.”  

Then the first soldiers pressed their way into the crowd. Blue and gold uniforms surged forward, meeting a wall of brown-robed bodies who pushed back without giving ground.  

Sim’s voice climbed. “We need to leave.”  

The air had not yet broken, but it was bracing itself. Just a breath, held too long. A single wrong moment, and everything would turn.  

Bast rolled his shoulders, exhaling long and low. As if standing still was costing him something.  

I made my choice.  

“Bast.” My voice was low. Steady. “Find us a way around.”  

Bast turned his head slightly, just enough that the city’s half-light caught in his eyes. His grin was wide and lazy, but there was nothing careless about it.  

“Oh,” he murmured. “Now you like my tricks.”  

“Bast. Now.”  

He sighed, tilting his head back. His gaze flicked up toward rooftops, then down a tight alley none of us had even glanced at twice. His fingers flexed by his side.  

Then, unhurried as ever, Bast slipped toward the alley with the grace of someone who has never once been caught.  

Wil kept his voice low beside me.  

“You trust him to know where he’s going?”  

No.  

But that didn’t matter.  

Steel caught the light across the square.  

“I trust him to move as if he belongs,” I said. “And half the time, that’s enough.”  

### * * *  

We walked until the White Citadel rose before us, and by then my legs ached and my fine new tunic had gathered the dull grit of Renere’s streets.  

If Severen had shimmered with nobility, Roderick’s court simply burned. Everything was too white, polished within an inch of sanity. The fortress stabbed upward, high and narrow, its upper towers so distant I tilted too far back trying to count them.  

Sim steadied me with a hand. “Someone would have charged you tax for looking too long.”  

I would have laughed. But then I saw what rolled past the gates.  

A carriage. Heavy. Gilded. Loud in every possible way, the kind of garish thing that used gold like perfume.  

And on its door, pressed in shining metal, was a crest I knew too well.  

House Jakis.  

Wil stepped neatly into my path before I could so much as breathe forward. “I know that face, Kvothe.”  

“She doesn’t belong here,” I told him, though my throat had seized up tight.  

“She was living under the University, Kvothe.” Sim’s voice was almost gentle, and that made it worse. “What if she’s better here?”  

“She won’t be.” The air in my chest burned. “She can’t be.”  

I tried to step around him. Wil held his ground.  

“Brilliant plan. Charge headfirst into the White Citadel and get thrown in a stone cell before the hour’s end.”  

“Fine. We bluff our way inside.” My voice hardly sounded like my own. “We find her before Ambrose gets his claws in.”  

### * * *  

Disguises are tricky things. The bad ones depend on deception. The good ones depend on truth, on choosing which truths to wear and how brightly to wear them.  

And it happened that I carried a single dangerous truth. A writ of patronage from the Maer of Vintas, in whose court I had once served as musician.  

After we arranged rooms at a nearby inn called the Blind Beggar, I left my lute there, tucked beneath the bed where I could pretend it was safe. Then I moved through the market with practiced efficiency. I gathered only the barest essentials. I chose a silk sash in sapphire and ivory for the Maer’s colors, a ribbon to tuck into Sim’s curls, and a tailored waistcoat with silver buckles for Wil.  

It was Wil who said it. “Simmon cannot come.”  

Sim looked stung, but Wil was right. A fourth son of the Duke of Dalonir would be recognized in a Vintish court. One wrong glance and Ambrose would have all the ammunition he needed.  

Bast took the waistcoat from Sim, adjusting his cuffs as though the matter had already been decided.  

“You can’t come either,” I said. “The court will be full of iron.”  

“I have carried worse than iron in my teeth and smiled about it after.” The words came out of him with a lilting cadence, musical and strange, as if he were reciting something half-remembered from a song. “You need a pair of eyes in there that see what yours cannot.”  

Walking up to the gate, I felt naked. Stripped of everything that made me dangerous, everything that made me myself. I held the writ out with steady hands. Keeping them still required focus, and it left me with less to spare for everything else.  

The officer frowned at the parchment, glanced at the sapphire sash, and waved us through.  

Wil exhaled once we were beyond earshot. “You make that look too easy.”  

“That’s the trick,” I said. “If you pretend to belong, half the time, nobody checks.”  

### * * *  

Inside was extravagance of a kind I had no frame for.  

Rows of marble pillars held aloft a vaulted ceiling five stories high, every surface carved or gilded. Murals covered the upper walls, the Calanthis family line rendered in pigment and gold leaf stretching back generations. Tapestries hung between them, vast as sails.  

The hall was already full. Nobility packed the lower floor, the mingled scent of perfume and ambition hanging thick. I scanned the crowd with a performer’s eye, marking faces, measuring distances. Near the upper balcony I spotted Baronet Pettur leaning close to that gossiping fool Lord Praevek, and set apart from them, watching the dais below with owlish attention, Bredon.  

They knew my circumstances with the Maer, or enough of the shape of them to be dangerous. I steered us deeper into the crowd.  

“Stay close,” I murmured. “And stay quiet.”  

Bast’s lips twitched. “I am the very soul of what is careful and discreet.”  

Wil said nothing. His dark eyes were already cataloging the room.  

Then the fanfare sounded. Two trumpets, sharp and bright, and the crowd went silent. A herald stepped forward on the dais, a man so layered in red and gold embroidery that he seemed less dressed than upholstered.  

“Hear ye! All rise in reverence for His Majesty King Roderick Calanthis, second of his name, sovereign Lord of all Vintas, ruler from the Centhe Sea to the peaks of the Stormwal Mountains!”  

Roderick was not the figure his portraits promised. The paintings showed commanding height, a jaw set in bronze certainty. The man who took the throne was slight, wiry, his beard graying. His eyes swept the hall with the look of a man accustomed to being watched, who had learned the appearance of seeing everything.  

“Also be upstanding for Her Majesty Queen Rinne, first of her name.”  

The Queen entered with measured grace. She smiled, but unhealed lines of concern still circled her eyes.  

The herald’s voice rang out once more. “Her Royal Highness Princess Ariel, first of her name.”  

The rest of his words dissolved.  

A young woman entered the hall. Golden hair drawn back in a tight braid, pinned with a precision that had nothing to do with her. A gown of pale blue silk that pooled at her feet. She moved up the steps to the dais with the deliberate care of someone walking across ice.  

Auri.  

My little moon-fey, who danced barefoot on the rooftops and spoke to the moon as if it might answer. Who named every forgotten thing in the Underthing and kept them all in their proper place. Who had once given me a key and told me it would keep me safe.  

She took her seat beside Roderick. His hand moved as if to reach for her, then returned to the armrest. It was a small thing. I might have imagined it.  

Her gloved hands settled in her lap, fingers curled with patient tension, the way you hold something that hurts.  

She was smiling. A smile that had been taught. Practiced until it sat correctly on her face.  

It was the worst thing I had ever seen.  

My focus slipped. The tremor returned to my right hand and I clenched it shut, pressing Auri’s ring hard against my finger.  

“She is not well,” Bast said quietly.  

The hall hushed. Roderick rose.  

“As many here know, we have been beset by more than our share of tragedy of late.” His voice carried well. It found the tone that courts require. “Yet today I stand before you with glad tidings. My daughter, who was lost to us, has been returned. For this mercy, we have one man to thank.”  

Ambrose Jakis pressed through the crowd with the unhurried confidence of a man entering a room he owned. Deep Vintish blue, gold thread at the cuffs. He mounted the steps and knelt before the king.  

“Your Majesty. I am grateful I could be of service.”  

Roderick inclined his head. “The courtesy you have rendered this court deserves reward. Speak, and if what you ask is just, it shall be yours.”  

Ambrose let the silence hold. Long enough to suggest humility. Short enough to show confidence.  

“There is something I would ask, Your Majesty.” His gaze moved to Auri for just a moment. A gesture designed to look tender. “During our journey, your daughter and I grew fond of one another. It is my deepest hope, with your consent, to ask for her hand.”  

The whispers that followed were too even, too knowing. Every word had been rehearsed, agreed upon before a single syllable was spoken aloud. The court was watching a play whose ending had already been written.  

I looked at Auri. She had not moved.  

I was through the crowd before I knew I had moved.  

“No.”  

My voice rang across the marble. Every head in the hall turned.  

I stood at the foot of the dais stairs, sapphire sash askew, every part of me strung tight. My hands were shaking freely now and I could not stop them.  

“This man did not rescue your daughter. He took her from the only safe place she had.”  

Gasps. A murmur that rippled outward.  

Ambrose turned to Roderick with practiced concern.  

“Your Majesty. This is Kvothe, a student from the University.” His voice was steady, almost gentle. “He was recently confined to Haven.” He paused, letting the name do its work. “I’m afraid he formed an attachment to your daughter during her time near the University. His fixation has been a matter of some concern.”  

“Your Majesty,” I said. I heard my voice crack. “She doesn’t want this.”  

Roderick’s jaw tightened.  

“You present yourself in the colors of Alveron.” His voice found a deeper coldness with every word. “You carry a writ of patronage from the Maer. And yet you disrupt my court with accusations that carry the weight of nothing.” He paused. “It grieves me to do so. But until the Maer’s offices can account for this, you will be confined.”  

Guards moved from the walls.  

Six of them. Hands on hilts.  

“Kvothe,” came Wil’s voice, and Bast moved to press his hand against my chest.  

“She’s afraid,” I said. I was not shouting now. “She is terrified, and none of you can see it.”  

Roderick’s eyes moved to his daughter. The skin around them drew tight. His hand found the armrest again, and this time he gripped.  

Auri sat motionless. Her smile held.  

“Remove him,” Roderick said. His voice was steady. His knuckles were white.  

A gauntleted hand closed on my arm. I wrenched free. Another caught the back of my coat.  

“Wait.”  

The voice was small. Barely a sound at all.  

Everyone stopped.  

Auri had risen from her seat. She stood at the edge of the dais, small and pale in her stiff gown, her gloved hands clasped before her.  

She was looking at me.  

“Please don’t hurt him.” Quiet as falling dust. A voice that had learned to be careful. “He was kind to me. At the University. He brought me things and was kind.”  

The hall was silent.  

Roderick looked at his daughter. The Queen dropped her smile.  

For a long moment the king did not move. Then something shifted behind his eyes, something that had nothing to do with courts or crowns. It was the look of a father who sees his child flinch.  

“For the sake of my daughter’s gentle spirit,” he said, “the cell will not be necessary.” Then, as if sensing he needed to be the king, “But you will not set foot on these grounds until summoned. See them out.”  

The guards were not gentle about it. They were not required to be. What happened between the throne room and the outer gate left no official marks. An elbow driven hard into my ribs on a staircase. A boot that found my shin on a landing.  

The last thing I saw before the doors closed was Auri settling back into her chair. Her hands returned to her lap. Her smile returned to her face.  

Ambrose leaned close and whispered something.  

The doors shut.  

### * * *  

We stood outside the Citadel in the failing light. My ribs ached. My shin throbbed. My hands shook freely, and I let them.  

*He was kind to me.*  

Wil leaned against the wall, arms crossed, his face unreadable. Bast stood apart, his eyes fixed on the closed gates with a patience that did not look like patience at all.  

The writ was worthless now. The disguise was finished. Every noble in that hall had seen my face, heard my name. Every door I had was closed.  

I pressed my back against the cold stone. Auri’s ring caught the last light on my finger, the pale amber warm against the gray.  

After a long silence, Wil was the one to speak. “Kvothe,” he murmured. “We have company.”  

I looked up just as the man arrived. He stepped into the flickering torchlight without hurry, dressed in a coat that shimmered like an oil-slick in the evening dark. His mustache was precise as a quill line, his rings gleaming just enough to catch notice without appearing garish.  

“Quite the bold performance you made in there,” he said, his voice warm with amusement. “Kvothe, isn’t it? Or should I call you by a name that’s a bit more inventive?”  

I hadn’t given him my name. That fact settled like iron in my stomach.  

“I don’t believe we’ve been introduced,” I said lightly, keeping my voice steady.  

He smiled, showing all his teeth. “Nor have we. I am Fascino. Regent of nothing important, though I suspect our interests overlap.” He paused, fixing me with the appraising look of a jeweler examining a stone. “For example. You seem quite familiar with our dear, luminous Princess Ariel.”  

The air left my lungs. I was conscious of Bast stilling beside me. Of Wil shifting his weight.  

Fascino saw it all. And smiled again.  

“She is a delight, isn’t she?” he continued, each word placed with the precision of a man setting stones on a board. “Our lost princess returned. Our jewel of court. They say she was found near the University, wandering half-mad beneath the city streets. A tragedy, really. But fortunate, all things considered.”  

I met his gaze. “Fortunate for whom?”  

“Oh, for many,” Fascino said easily, flicking a speck of dust from his sleeve. “For King Roderick, it means the joy of having his wayward daughter returned as if by magic. For the ladies of the court, it’s the thrill of welcoming a new curiosity among them.” He let his words linger, savoring their taste. “And, more than all these, there is something for the Jakis heir as well. He now finds himself basking in the golden company of royalty.”  

The wrongness of it sat in me like a swallowed stone.  

Fascino tilted his head, watching me with quiet interest. “I am hosting a gathering tonight at the Palazzo de Contraier. It will be a private affair, with no guards and no prying eyes. You should come. It might benefit you to mingle with others who hold a certain distaste for that Jakis boy.”  

He stepped back, all coiled grace. Then he turned, leaving a faint trace of perfume in his wake.  

Wil let out a hard breath. “Kvothe, do you trust him?”  

I should have said no.  

But I was watching Fascino retreat into the dusk, his movements too smooth, his offer too careful, and I knew.  

“It’s not a question of trust,” I murmured. “But of choice.”
