# CHAPTER 1.

## THE WEIGHT OF SILENCE.


MORNING CREPT INTO THE Waystone Inn. It did not rush. It came on quiet feet, as if ashamed to wake what darkness might still be dreaming. It pooled in the corners, thin as old regret, gathering where the stones cracked, settling in the bones where ache begins and numbness ends.

The red-haired innkeeper lay still, counting his breaths. A pain pulsed through his ribs, waiting for movement before deciding if it was real. Deeper, joints murmured their old complaints, and not all their muttering was from yesterday’s beating. He had been many things in his life, quick and clever and more, but today he was simply sore.

Yesterday, he’d run on borrowed strength. He'd swept the floor and served supper on the back of adrenaline. For Bast. For Chronicler. For the memory of himself. But stamina keeps its own ledger and the reckoning always arrives.

And so pain greeted him now with the familiar patience of an old collector. Cruel. Exacting. Thorough. 

He tried to rise, and failed. It was not the dramatic collapse of a stage tragedy, nor a fall worth laughter. Instead it was graceless and heavy. No one watches a man fail in private. That’s what makes it real.

He sneezed. The smoke from last night lingered, a bitter tang of scorched cloth and coal that scratched at his lungs. Coalsmoke is not like woodsmoke, not warm, not gentle. It is something harsher. Bitter as iron. Familiar as folly.

He breathed. Gritted his teeth. Tried again.

This time he made it. No grace, no heroics. Just a small success carved inch by painful inch. He moved like a man playing through a part once memorized. Sit. Wait. Stand. Wait again.

As he passed the foot of the bed, his eyes dropped almost thoughtlessly to the floor. To the space once occupied by his thrice-locked chest. It was gone now. He knew it was gone. He’d moved it himself.

But the space stared back at him.

That was the cruelty of absence. How it left certain corners more full than any presence ever could. The floorboards beneath were paler, the grain untouched, unmarred. The quiet witness to years of weight now removed.

There were grooves too, faint scars where Roah wood had kissed the floor overlong. They’d fade, in time. Just like everything else.

He sneezed again. The air caught. His back popped twice.

Stupid.

He remembered how he’d hurt it earlier in the predawn hours, foolish and fevered from insomnia. Too proud for patience, too tired for care. He’d dropped his walking stick under the chest and levered it an inch at a time, breath hitching all the while. Then the trapdoor and the cellar yawning beneath. A dark windless place meant for secrets. He’d opened it with both hands and let the chest drop. Just like that. A clean, heavy fall.

The sound should’ve thundered, but it didn’t. The Waystone swallowed it whole. It ate noise the way stone eats heat. What should have been a crash became something worse. A silence too deep to echo.

He’d stared after it for a time before following. Listening for anything. Waiting, maybe, for something to answer back. But the dark only answered with more dark.

The dawn had been near when he crawled out again. Empty in the way that isn’t hunger. Hollow in the way a bell is hollow when it forgets how to sing.

Another ache surfaced. Not sharp, merely insistent. Pain can be set aside. Regret will wait its turn. But nature, blunt and honest, will not be bargained with. There are some indignities a man cannot debate.

When he returned, the kettle waited. It was soot-black, solid, and familiar. The sort of companion who expected nothing but notice. He set it on the iron ring and lit the flame beneath with careful hands.

From a paper pouch, he pinched dry leaves that were bitter as myth and green as regret. Nahirout. Rare, sharp, and blunt in equal measure. It didn’t cure. It didn’t heal. It stole. It robbed pain of speech for an hour and left you too empty to argue.

The kettle began to whisper long before it sang. This was not the whistle of a young, eager flame. Instead, this was a strained breath. Even boiling water had learned to keep its voice down in the Waystone.

When steam rose, he brewed it darker than ever. No honey. No sweetening. Nothing but heat and silence. He sipped once, then again, and felt the ache in his ribs dull to a whisper. He felt the trembling behind his eyes hush for now.

He did not feel better. But he could move.

Praise cleverness, he thought, with a bitterness to match the tea. Clever enough to find his own supply when no tinker was in town, and clever enough to tell himself that a daily cup was nothing more than an old habit. Clever, even, for forgetting whether the ache in his chest was old magic gone to rot or simply broken ribs.

He dressed in silence. Each motion was measured, each breath a quiet bargain. Outside, the light eased its way across the window. Its golden fingers hesitantly prodding the room for life.

He left the room without straightening his shirt, and without reclaiming his mask. They knew him too well by now.

And pain, after all, was its own mask.

### * * *

The common room met him with its usual silence, but this morning, the quiet had edges.

Not the hush of early hour or unlit lamps. This silence was waiting. It clung to the space where ritual usually lived.

The hearth held only ash and no firewood had been brought up from the shed. In the kitchen, the bread board lay empty and clean. The pump hadn’t been primed, and no kettle hissed on the stove.

The red-haired innkeeper shuffled through the rooms, seeing all of it, and did nothing.

Some mornings, the shape of the day came in flour-dusted fingers and kettle steam. Today, it did not.

Across the room, Bast’s eyes flickered toward the unlit hearth. His mouth opened slightly, then closed again. His normal mischief bowing to the uncertain start.

Chronicler sat hunched low at a table. His page was half-written, half-smudged, and worrying itself into ruin beneath a trembling hand. He was far from ink and farther from words.

“Reshi, you look like death,” came Bast’s voice from behind the bar. “And that’s not a compliment.” A folded cloth dangled limp in his hand. He hadn’t been wiping anything. Just holding a gesture that had long since lost its reason.

“I’m standing,” Kote said evenly, moving cautiously toward Chronicler. “Well, mostly.”

“Barely,” Bast retorted. “Sit. Before the floor claims you and the drama gives Chronicler a nosebleed.”

When Kote sat, he did not groan. At least not loudly. Then, clasping his hands on the worn table top, he stared past them as though listening for something in the stillness.

“The tea helps,” he offered.

Bast rolled his eyes and folded into his own chair like someone sitting beside a wound.

Chronicler twisted in his seat, quill hovering, hand waiting.

Kote sneezed. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand, slow and tired.

“I thought,” he said, “that with my purse full, nothing could stand in my way. That hard times were behind me.”

He let the silence linger. His voice grew softer, more gentle.

“But answers are never so kind. They were just out of reach, and I was smug enough to imagine they might come without a cost.”

He looked toward the windows, then farther. Beyond them. Beyond the village. Beyond himself.

When he spoke again, his tone had shifted, spilling into something deeper, something older. “Gather round and listen well,” he said, his words quiet but commanding. “For this is no triumphant song, no grand tale. This is a story shaped from sorrow. A tale of tragedy.”

The words came to rest. Subtle, but colder than silence. Chronicler bent to the page, pen trembling once more into motion, and Kote, or at least the man who hid behind that name, spoke the first true words of the day.
