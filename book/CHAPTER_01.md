# CHAPTER 1  

## THE WEIGHT OF SILENCE  

MORNING CREPT INTO THE Waystone Inn like regret. It was slow, chill-fingered, and sharp in the brittle places a younger man might mistake for numbness.

The red-haired innkeeper lay still, breathing shallow and quiet through his teeth. The pain nested in his ribs was a spreading ache that had not yet decided whether it was dull or sharp. Somewhere deeper, joints murmured old protest, not all of it from yesterday’s beating. He had been many things in his life, but today, he was simply sore.

There are bruises youth ignores, he thought. And others youth earns, bruises that memory grinds down into the bone. Age doesn’t forgive them. It collects them.

Yesterday he’d run on borrowed strength. He'd swept the floor and served supper on the back of adrenaline masquerading as resolve. For Bast. For Chronicler. For the memory of himself. But the price was always waiting, always exact.

Pain greeted him like an old collector now. Not cruel, merely thorough.

He tried to rise, and failed. It was not the dramatic collapse of stage tragedy, nor a fall worth laughter. But it was graceless, and heavy, and unseen. So it was only sad.

No one watches a man fail in private. That’s what makes it real.

The sour tang of acid-burnt cloth and coalsmoke prickled his nose, the clinging remnants of the night before. Not the warm scent of woodsmoke, but something sharper. Bitter as iron. Familiar as failure.

He breathed. Gritted his teeth. Tried again.

The second time, he made it. No grace, no heroics. Just a small success carved inch by painful inch. He moved like a man playing through a part once memorized: Sit. Wait. Stand. Wait again.

He did not wince. Not loudly.

As he passed the bed, his eyes dropped almost thoughtlessly to the floor near its foot. To the space once occupied by his thrice-locked chest. It was gone now. He knew it was gone. He’d moved it himself.

But the space stared back at him.

That was the cruelty of absence: how it left certain corners more full than any presence ever could. The floorboards beneath were paler, the grain untouched, unmarred. Quiet witness to years of weight now removed. Ghostweight, still pressing.

There were grooves too, faint scars where Roah wood had kissed the floor overlong. They’d fade, in time. Just like everything else.

He chuffed laughter through his nose. The air caught. His back popped, twice.

Stupid.

He remembered how he’d done it in the predawn hours, foolish and fevered from insomnia. Too proud to leave well enough alone, too tired to try gently. He’d dropped his walking stick under the chest and levered it an inch at a time, breath hitching all the while. Cleverness, he reminded himself, was often late to arrive. Folly? Folly rarely missed an invitation.

Then the trapdoor. The cellar yawning beneath. A dark windless place meant for secrets. He’d opened it with both hands and let the chest drop. Just like that. A clean, heavy fall.

The sound should’ve thundered, but it didn’t. The Waystone swallowed it whole. It ate noise the way stone eats heat. What should have been a crash became something worse. A silence too deep to be echoed.

He’d stared after it for a time before following. Listening for anything. Waiting, maybe, for something to answer back. But the dark only answered with more dark.

The dawn had been near when he crawled out again. Empty in the way that isn’t hunger. Hollow in the way a bell is hollow when it forgets how to sing.

That same hollow pulsed in his belly now. Not sharp, just insistent.

Pain can be ignored. Regret will wait. But nature, at the door, will not. There are indignities a man does not get to debate.

So he obeyed. 

### * * *

When he returned, the kettle waited: soot-black, solid, and familiar. The sort of companion who expected nothing but notice. He set it on the iron ring and lit the flame beneath with careful hands.

From a paper pouch, he pinched dry leaves that were bitter as myth and green as regret. Nahirout. Rare, sharp, and blunt in equal measure. It didn’t cure. It didn’t heal. It stole. It robbed pain of speech for an hour and left you too empty to argue.

The kettle began to whisper long before it sang. This was not the whistle of a young, eager flame. Instead, this was a strained breath, strangled and weary. Even boiling water had learned to keep its voice down in the Waystone.

When steam rose, he brewed it darker than ever. No honey. No sweetening. Nothing but heat and silence. He sipped once, then again, and felt the ache in his ribs dull to a whisper. Felt the trembling behind his eyes hush for now.

He did not feel better. But he could move.

Praise cleverness, he thought, with a bitterness to match the tea. Clever enough to build a cellar forge in secret. Clever enough to find supply when coin ran dry. Clever enough to lean on leaf and silence until he forgot whether the ache in his chest came from failing spells or shattered ribs.

By the time he dressed, with each motion measured and each breath negotiated, the light had crept into the windows like an apology. Pale gold, uncertain. It did not reach the corners.

He stepped outside without straightening his shirt, and without reclaiming his mask. They knew him too well by now.

And pain, after all, wears its own face. 

### * * *

The common room met him with its usual silence, but this morning, the quiet had edges.

Not the hush of early hour or unlit lamps. This silence was waiting. It clung to the space where ritual usually lived.

The hearth held only ash. No firewood had been brought up from the shed. The bread board lay empty and clean. The pump hadn’t been primed. No kettle hissed on the stove.

Kote paused in the doorway, seeing all of it, and did nothing.

Some mornings, the shape of the day came in flour-dusted fingers and kettle steam. Today, it did not.

Across the room, Bast’s eyes flicked toward the unlit hearth. His mouth opened slightly, then closed again. Even his mischief bowed to the weight of it. 

Chronicler sat hunched low, smaller than his own shadow. His page was half-written, half-smudged, worrying itself into ruin beneath a trembling hand. He was far from ink and farther from words.

“Reshi, you look like death,” came Bast’s voice from behind the bar. Sharp and musical. “And that’s not a compliment.” A folded cloth dangled limp in his hand. He hadn’t been wiping anything. Just holding a gesture that had long since lost its reason.

“I’m standing,” Kote said evenly, moving toward the hearth with a gait edged in caution. “Mostly.”

“Barely,” Bast retorted. “Sit. Before the floor claims you and the drama gives Chronicler a nosebleed.”

When Kote sat, he did it gracefully if your definition of grace was ‘without groaning aloud.’ He clasped his hands on the worn table top, stared past them as though listening for something in the stillness.

“The tea helps,” he offered.

Bast folded into his own chair like someone sitting beside a wound.

Chronicler twisted in his seat, quill hovering.

“I’d thought, with funds in hand, that nothing could stop me. That the hard part was behind me.” He paused, his voice softening. “But answers are never so kind. They were close, so close, and I was smug enough to imagine they might come without a cost.”

He looked toward the windows, then farther, beyond them, beyond the village, beyond himself.

When he spoke again, his tone had shifted, spilling into something deeper, something older. “Gather round and listen well,” he said, his words quiet but commanding. “For this is no triumphant song, no grand tale. This is a story shaped from sorrow. A tale of tragedy.”  

The words came to rest like frost. Subtle, but colder than silence. Chronicler bent to the page, pen trembling once more into motion, and Kote, the man who hid behind that name, spoke the first true words of the day.
