# CHAPTER 01

## The Weight of Silence  

Morning swept over Kote like the drip of cold water from a leaky roof—sharp, unavoidable, and precise in its cruelty. He lay still at first, his breathing thin and awkward in his chest. His ribs burned, but it was a dull ache lower that refused to let him rest. Aging wasn’t what he’d thought it would be. Most nights he didn’t even sleep through till dawn. The need to empty himself dragged him out of bed, less urgent than it was insulting. There was no dignity in waking for such a thing.  

Still, the demand grew sharper as the moments passed, impossible to ignore. With a sour grimace, Kote swung his legs over the edge of the bed. He winced at the pull in his ribs and the slow, familiar grind of his knees. His first attempt to stand was half-hearted, grudging, and doomed for it. He pushed too fast and crumbled just as quickly, falling back onto the mattress with a pained grunt.  

The wood floor groaned under this small failure. Kote glared at it, half-expecting the floorboards to complain further. *It seemed fitting,* he thought. *Even inanimate things could fail under strain.* He pressed a hand to his side, exhaling slowly through his nose. It didn’t matter that he hated to rise; no amount of hatred would make the world care less.  

His second attempt came slower. He braced his hands on the edge of the bed and guided his weight to his feet like a man cautiously introducing himself to the ground. Each shallow inhale pushed against protesting ribs, but this time, the world held. Barely.  

The room greeted him in quiet disarray. A desk lingered by the far wall like it feared being noticed, its top cluttered with uneven piles of papers that threatened to tumble at the slightest breeze. One corner of the shelf near it remained bare, empty of the chest that once seemed part of the wood itself. The emptiness expanded like a held breath, uneasy and waiting. He frowned at it, running a hand over the stubble on his face. He didn’t like what the empty space meant. More than that, he didn’t like the shape of it.  

No answers came, and the dull ache in his bladder refused to let him linger. When he returned, the kettle waited on the stove, blackened with years of use. He reached for it with deliberate, slow motions, the stiffness in his limbs reminding him that even this hurt now. The nahirout leaves were bitter between his fingers, and the scent they released as they steeped filled the room with something sharp and grounding. Steam curled upward, and he watched it rise, twisting in ways so complex and delicate they seemed like the beginnings of runes. If only such simple things could hold power.  

The tea burned as he drank it, but it steadied him. Heat spread through his chest and his empty stomach, warming him by degrees as he sat back down. Leaning over to place the kettle back on the stove, he hissed softly at the sharp pain in his ribs.  

He swallowed another mouthful of tea, his hands cupped around the clay mug. It helped—though not as much as he hoped. Some part of him, foolish and persistent, still clung to the notion that pain could be brewed away, dissolved like sugar in water. He knew better.  

Still, the day demanded he rise again. He dressed without ceremony, pulling a patched linen shirt over his shoulders and tugging his worn, gray boots tight. The effort left him dull and heavy, but as his eyes grazed the now-empty spot on the shelf, something sharper pressed against his thoughts. Regret. Responsibility. Once again, that emptiness—a chasm waiting to be leapt, a missing thing he could neither ignore nor retrieve—seemed to thrum in the quiet of the room.

The common room greeted Kote the Innkeeper with the creaking timbre of old wood beneath his boots, its silence brittle and cold. It was not a soft silence, not the comfortable stillness of a room simply left alone. This quiet had edges. It prickled, hummed, and hung in the air as though waiting for something to break it.  

Sunlight slanted weakly through the windows, never quite reaching the corners where shadows clung. The tables sat somber, their worn surfaces traced with gouges and scratches faded with age. At one of them, Chronicler hunched lower than the chairs themselves, his hand frozen above a page that showed more smudges than words. His gaze hovered somewhere between the ruined parchment and the ash-filled hearth, too burdened by unsaid thoughts to lift.  

Bast’s voice lashed out from behind the bar, sharp as a clean-struck bell. “You look like death, Reshi. That’s not a compliment. Sit down before you fall on something sharp and finish the job yourself.”  

His casual grin didn’t match the tension in his posture, the cloth in his hand forgotten, limp as a broken string. His sharp blue eyes landed on Kote’s every movement, cataloging every wince, every breath drawn too shallow.  

“I’m fine,” Kote said evenly, his gaze on the table nearest the hearth as he moved toward it with painstaking care. The rawness of his stride carried a quiet precision, every motion a necessity weighed against pain. When he sank into the chair, he folded his fingers loosely together but didn’t look down. “Hover if you must, Bast, but spare me your fretting.”  

Bast’s chin dipped slightly in response, his jaw tightening at the edges. He dragged out a chair, the scrape of its legs loud against the floor, and perched on it as though hoping it might collapse so he wouldn’t have to stay.  

Chronicler, meanwhile, moved like a man startled out of deep water. He motioned with his quill, then set it trembling midair, poised above his work. His ink-stained fingers twitched as if they longed for clarity they weren’t bold enough to demand.  

Kote spoke without preamble. “The tea helps,” he said simply, his gaze skimming over Bast with a flicker of amusement before turning sober again.  

The weight in the room seemed to shift, folding itself closer around the three of them. Kote tilted his head, looking into the middle distance where the sunlight failed to reach. “I’d thought—with funds in hand—that nothing could stop me. That the hard part was behind me.” He paused, his voice softening. “But answers are never so kind. They were close—so close—and I was smug enough to imagine they might come without a cost.” He sighed then, a quiet, weary thing, and looked past the other two men to the far corner of the room. The light didn’t seem to reach that far.  

When he spoke again, his tone had shifted, spilling into something deeper, something older. “Gather round and listen well,” he said, his words quiet but commanding. “For this is no triumphant song, no grand tale. This is a story shaped from sorrow. A tale of tragedy.”  

The room, so recently filled with warmth, seemed colder somehow as those final words settled into the air. Chronicler began to write, and Kote, the man who hid behind that name, spoke the first true words of the day.
