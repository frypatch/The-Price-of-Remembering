# CHAPTER 3.

## THE SILENT TOLL.


I SAT IN THE ARCHIVES, surrounded by a small fortress of books. “Numbered Names.” “Feyda’s Legacy.” “Child-Charms of the Western Vale.” “Hashar’s Curtain.” Each one a brick, placed. A scholar might have called it comparative research. A sympathist might have said I was drawing lines, looking for patterns. But the truth was simpler. I was chasing shadows. Shadows wearing old names.  

I was three pages deep into “Numbered Names”, working my way through a tangled verse of Mid-Shaldaic couplets, when I caught sight of Ambrose Jakis. His Vintish robes were a bright red that did nothing to flatter his face and his hair was swept back with such deliberation that it looked like it had cost gold. His scent arrived before he did, cloying with rose oil and a hint of whatever powder arrogance is made from.  

“Re’lar Kvothe,” he said, stopping short of my chair. “Conquering the Archives one aisle at a time, are we?” He waited, but when I kept my eyes on my work he made a show of gesturing at my books in mock admiration. “What is it now? Lullabies for restless children, or researching adolescent fancies?”  

I did what any man does when he finds a roach loose on his dinner plate. I set my eyes hard upon my notes, as if, by staring, I could burn a hole straight through the page. I hunched lower, forcing my back to him.  

He leaned in close enough that I could feel his breath on my neck. “Still charmingly tight-lipped,” he murmured, his voice pitched for my ears alone. “Must be exhausting, all that silent brilliance.” Then his hand slid into view, coming to rest on the open pages before me. Breaking my line of sight. Claiming my book as his own.  

I looked up at last.  

“I’m using that,” I said evenly.  

Ambrose smiled, if you could call it that. It showed his teeth, tops and bottoms, without any kind of fattening on the upper cheeks. “And yet you did not properly file a request.” He produced a ledger slip with the scriv’s mark. “Priority claim, logged and stamped,” he said, placing it atop the book like a winning hand in a game I hadn’t known we were playing. “Dreadfully unfortunate, isn’t it? Your claim only counts if you mark it in the ledger.”  

“You did this on purpose.”  

“Of course I did. It makes me ill to see Edema Ruh fingers paw at the University’s collection. Scrivs gave years to these shelves, binding what would’ve rotted into ruin. And you stroll in, thinking you deserve what they built, without even the courtesy of filing a proper request.”  

He withdrew the book, gently, lovingly, like he meant to mount it on a plaque. He turned a few pages as he did, pretending to skim.  

I reached for “Feyda’s Legacy” instead, but Ambrose just tutted and lifted another ledger slip from his pocket. “Ah, this one too, I’m afraid.” Then, gathering up my other book, he turned to go.  

“I still need those,” I said.  

He paused. The set of his shoulders softened, just slightly. As if he carried a private joke, and it warmed him from within. “Then you’ll need to learn to place requests like grown students do. I’ll be using the north reading nook for the next several days.”  

He walked away with the resolve of a draccus deciding to cross a grove. A thick silence crept in behind him. The sort of hush that settles after something has been stolen, expertly and unfairly, leaving behind no course for the victim to remediate.  

Renner’s eyes flicked up. Just for a moment. Then back to the ledger, as if nothing had happened. As if watching justice slip past had become commonplace, stitched into the quiet rhythm of his days. Rules over reason. Rules over mercy. Always the rules.  

I let my fingers rest on the empty space where “Numbered Names” had been. The wood was cool under my skin, the empty space colder still.  

I hadn’t logged the books. It was as simple as that. But part of me hadn’t wanted even the scrivs knowing what old shadows I was chasing. That’s the trouble with pride. It blinds you to foxes wearing silk smiles.  

My hands shook.  

Before I could still them, the bell rang.  

Not the brassy chime of a class change. Not the celebration of a well-rung peal.  

The Iron Bell. Low. Slow. The breath of stone lungs. The heartbeat of an old god turning over in its sleep.  

I froze.  

The knell did not falter. It filled the hall, slow and steady as a tide. Students stilled. A scroll slipped from one hand and drifted down. A book found its place on the shelf, without thought or reason. Even Renner looked up, caught by the sound.  

The Iron Bell sang only one note.  

Mourning.  

### * * *  

The Eolian that evening carried on as it always did. Music drifted through the air, conversation hummed at the bar, and somewhere near the back came the soft, repetitive plucking of strings as someone tuned a lute before trying for their talent pipes. The world, it seemed, had not stopped turning.  

But our usual corner table felt like another place entirely.  

Wil, Simmon, Mola, Fela, and I sat together. No one spoke much. No one suggested cards or dice or any of the small diversions we usually turned to. Here, we were a note struck off key, surrounded by a melody that didn’t include us. But the alternative would have been for us all to bear this alone.  

Classes had been canceled for the span, an unprecedented occurrence. The official notice mentioned administrative shortages, reassignment of duties, and necessary meetings. But everyone knew better. The University never made space for grief unless it absolutely had to. And the absence of Herma, who had been fair, gentle, and measured, left everyone adrift, uncertain about their duties.  

Wil lifted his mug and broke the silence. “To the Chancellor Herma,” he said stiffly, taking a long swig. Then he stared back down into his scutten like it might answer a question he’d forgotten how to ask.  

Sim cleared his throat. “To the man who signed my sponsorship without asking what my father thought of it first,” he said, raising his cup slowly.  

Mola sat with her hands wrapped around her cup, expression carefully neutral. When she spoke, her voice was level but quiet. “To Herma, who found me in the stacks with my face in my hands. Who sat down beside me and stayed until I could talk.”  

Fela took a long breath. Her voice, when it came, was quiet and careful. “To the Chancellor who walked me back to Mews after that incident with Ambrose. Who didn’t ask questions or make it my fault. To a proper Chancellor. Whatever that means now.”  

I hadn’t meant to say anything at all. But their words hung like threads waiting to be tied. To add nothing would’ve made me feel like the knot had slipped. “To Herma,” I echoed.  

We drank.  

A bottle arrived a few minutes later, silent and unannounced. Vintish brandy, the good kind, not something a student could afford even on a lucky term. The cork had already been split. Deoch stood at the bar, glass in hand, not drinking. He wasn’t watching us directly, but he was keenly aware of everything. He hadn’t known Herma. Their circles barely touched. But he knew us. Knew the air of loss when it hung around a table. He sent the bottle and left us alone. That was just like him.  

We poured careful portions and fell quiet. The candle between us leaned in its wax cradle, its flame thinner than usual, as if mourning had its own gravity. My eyes fell to its uncertain flicker, how it trembled without wind.  

“Men and their walls,” Mola said at last, her eyes finding mine. “Wil went first. That’s hard.” She paused. “You went last. After hearing all of us.”  

I let my fingertips graze the side of the glass. Cool, smooth, untouched. I could have fashioned a clever retort. Some right-sounding answer to feather over the cracks. But I didn’t have any. Not the good kind.  

Fela pressed her fingers briefly to my wrist. “You don’t have to be careful with us, Kvothe. Not here.”  

Her touch grounded me more than I expected. The words came easier after that.  

“He was the first man at the University who didn’t treat me like I’d arrived by accident,” I said. “He remembered my name before I earned it. That sounds small, but it wasn’t. Not to me. He gave me the kind of silence that doesn’t shame you. You know the kind. The silence teachers use when they want to give you space to think instead of to apologize. He knew how to tie meaning with empty thread.”  

No one interrupted. Nothing needed to be added.  

We sat there for a while in a shared silence. That’s when the real words came. The ones I couldn’t give voice.  

The truth is, I hate losing things. More than that, I’m terrified of it.  

Herma’s death wasn’t just a loss. It was a knot left half-tied, a pattern begun but never finished. And I couldn’t stop picking at it. My mind circled back, over and over, searching for the thread that might unravel it all and make it make sense.  

It’s a sickness, I think, this need to fix what was never my doing. The ache to lay the world flat on the table and name its shape when all it wants to do is twist. I don’t know how to grieve gently. So instead, I dig.  

I didn’t speak those thoughts aloud.  

But I think Mola saw something in my face. That open, unfinished part of me I work so hard to bury.  

She didn’t say anything else. She just looked at me like she understood that my toast, while incomplete, was as much as I could give. And then she looked away, letting the moment fold itself down like a letter no longer needing to be read.  

### * * *  

The morning after Herma’s death arrived without ceremony. No sunbeam haloed the windows. No birds etched the silence. I woke late, head pounding, stomach churning, and mouth filled with the taste of last night’s sorrow. We’d toasted Herma at the Eolian, and I’d continued on when I got back to Anker’s.  

I didn’t rise at first. I lay still beneath the thin blanket in my small upstairs room at Anker’s, tracing the ceiling crack along a lazy seam. A pattern that meant nothing. Or everything. I couldn’t tell anymore.  

Memory returned slowly, as ground-damp seeping through stone. Each detail pooling in the low places grief had carved. Herma’s face appeared, not with the sharpness brought by illness, but softened in the half-light of recollection. A crooked smile came to mind, along with the way he tilted his head when puzzling over a particularly stubborn knot, fingers trembling slightly. I’d thought it merely concentration at the time. Now I wondered what else I’d missed, what other signs I’d been too wrapped in my own concerns to see.  

But he was gone. And the world had the gall to keep turning.  

Through the floor came the ordinary sounds of Anker’s common room. The scrape of a chair, the clink of plates, someone asking about the weather. The world was full of people who didn’t know Herma was dead. It felt like a betrayal.  

Eventually, I would have to join them. Eventually, I would have to become one of those people for whom life simply continued. But not yet.  

### * * *  

A week had passed and Herma was still gone.  

I crossed the Stonebridge to the University just before second bell, my shaed belted against the chill. The sun peeked through the lifting fog, gray-gold and washed out.  

Inside, the quiet still felt tired and sad. The scent of parchment and dust seemed thinner. The tension in the air no longer tingled with curiosity. Instead, it hung slack and unstrung, like a harp left untuned.  

I offered a nod as I passed the Scrivs’ counter. Only Renner was on duty this early, his eyes bracketed with weariness. He gave a perfunctory tilt of the head that might once have been a greeting.  

My feet turned of their own accord, leading me through the lower stacks, down a gray stone hallway I’d come to know well. I moved without thinking, the same way your hand finds half-forgotten scars.  

There had been a table toward the back, worn smooth in shallow troughs where countless elbows had rested. Herma and I had spent several measured afternoons there, parsing knot-codes from the Barony of Okorran. We had argued, though gently, about redundancies of vowel-float and semantic inversions embedded in the spacing.  

I reached it again. Still warn, still quiet.  

Even the dust hadn’t been disturbed.  

No record slips. No books left waiting for re-shelving. And most telling, no coils of knotted rope.  

My blood ticked louder in my ears.  

At the nearest counter, I waited until a scriv noticed me. She had short-cropped hair and the pallor of someone raised on too much lamp-light.  

“Excuse me,” I said as easily as I could manage. “I was working with several Yllish texts, mostly unbound knotworks sourced from the Maer’s third donation. They were shelved on level three, alcove M-fifteen. Are they being restored or are they available?”  

She barely looked up. “That collection’s been recategorized.”  

I blinked. “Recategorized?”  

“Administrative reassignment,” she clarified, brushing a ribbon of ink from her hand. “Now under the direct supervision of Master Brandeur. Restricted until further notice.”  

“Brandeur?” I kept my face still. “The Master Arithmetician?”  

“That’s right.” She said it as if it were the most natural thing in the world.  

But it wasn’t. This was Lorren’s realm. Having the Master Arithmetician supervise Yllish knotworks made as much sense as asking the Master Alchemist to tune the Artificery workshops.  

“Is that unusual?” I said carefully. “Wouldn’t Master Lorren typically handle interim linguistic duties himself?”  

The scriv’s expression didn’t change. “I don’t make the classifications. I just record them.”  

“And when was this reassignment made?”  

She consulted her ledger, running one finger down a column of entries. “Four days ago. And anything under Master supervision now requires written clearance.”  

Four days. I’d been at the Eolian drinking to Herma’s memory while someone had been here. Moving books. Changing ledgers. Locking doors.  

“I see,” I said. “And the ledger slips? There should be records of each knotwork’s prior circulation.”  

“Let me check.” She turned to a different logbook, flipping back several pages. Her frown deepened. “That’s strange. Your name should be here. Was there another designation you used?”  

I didn’t answer immediately. Because I had used my name. I logged them distinctly and consistently. The Maer’s patronage had granted me access. It had been documented, verified, sealed. Herma had even approved one under his seal for an independent study admission. That knotwork had been my connection to him these final months.  

Someone had gone through the ledgers. Someone with access and authority. Someone who knew which entries to erase and which to leave untouched.  

Someone who wanted them where Lorren wouldn’t look too closely.  

My hand found the edge of the counter. “No,” I said finally. “Just my name. Kvothe.”  

She made a small notation. “I can submit a request to Master Brandeur’s office if you need access restored.”  

“Thank you, but that won’t be necessary.” Not yet, anyway. Not until I understood what game was being played.  

I made my way back through the stacks, my mind turning over the pieces like a lock I couldn’t quite open. The knotworks restricted within days of Herma’s death. My access records erased from the ledgers. A Master Arithmetician given authority over linguistic texts.  

Some people, it seemed, had the power to decide what was remembered.  

And what was allowed to be forgotten.  

Herma deserved better than that.  

### * * *

Back in the upper stacks, I took a different stair. Not the eastern one, where the marble had worn soft in the center.

I needed to clear my head.

Instead, I found my fingers tracing ink along familiar paper. Not a journal, not exactly. Just a slim folio, always tucked beneath the table’s left shelf. Barely hidden, never sealed.

It wasn’t formally protected because it wasn’t meant to be. It wasn’t an archive. It was something more private, a kind of working sketchbook that Herma used to warm his hands against the cold of translation. It was a half-scribed place to stretch the mind before working real knots.

More than once, I’d watched him undo loops, scrawl alternate glyphs, knot half-thought riddles like seeds scattered in dry soil. It was equal parts study and scribble. The kind of space only someone serious about understanding ever bothers to make. 

He always left it here, half-buried beneath old parchment, like a bookmark between afternoons. Not forgotten. Just routine. A kind of ritual. His way of picking up the rhythm of last week so his hands wouldn’t wander today. I’d left margin-scribbles there myself before. Questions beside his thoughts, left like seeds. He never answered. Not in ink.

Then, on the third-to-last page, there is a single, complex glyph. It was knotted in both forward syntax and reversed. It was repetitive. Redundant. Wrong.

I stared at it. The longer I looked, the less sense it made. And yet it wanted something. Not speech, certainly. But structure. It echoed a kind of purposeful confusion. The way a cipher sometimes doubles back and eats its own tail.

“You left me pieces,” I whispered to the page.

And then I noticed it, a smudge. Faint. Not ink, not quite. A grayish crescent was tucked beneath one glyph’s loop, perhaps a thumbprint. It was not Herma’s. The shape was too thick, too firm.

I turned the journal gently in the light.

Branded parchment.

One watermark, just visible, ghosted along the page. It was the Arcane Bursar’s own. If ink could tell you who owned it, this page would shout of Hemme’s gatekeeping.

My fists itched. I could feel something slithering into shape, but I had too few pieces.

“You were never just failing,” I said to the ghost of Herma’s hand. “Were you?”

Nothing in the book answered. But absence speaks too. 

Outside, bells marked third bell with a softer voice. On this side of grief, I heard it differently. There was a pattern here. I could feel it tug, taut as breath. And I wasn’t letting it slip.

### * * *

The common room at Anker’s was quieter than usual, with no bellowing arguments over dice and no half-drunken students trying to rewrite ballads louder than the competition. Just the low hum of voices and the knock of tankards on old oak. Life moving forward, as it always does.

Simmon saw me first. He raised a hand from our corner table, two fingers lifted in lazy greeting. Wil was already seated across from him, arms crossed over his chest, one boot up on the bench. A small pile of dice sat between them, the evidence of a game grown tired or one interrupted.

I slid onto the bench beside Sim and laid Herma’s folio carefully on the table.

Wil gave it a glance. “We drinking tonight or introducing bedtime reading to the betting table?”

“He’s brooding,” Sim murmured too gently to sting.

“I’m,” I stopped. No clever deflection came. “There’s something wrong.”

They both looked at me.

Wil’s brow lifted. Sim’s creased with concern.

“Of course there is,” Wil said, leaning back. “The Chancellor’s dead. Hemme’s stomping around with a seal he doesn’t deserve, and Brandeur’s pretending to matter.”

Sim cut in before I could answer. “Whatever you think’s crawling under the floorboards, Kvothe, it isn’t going to undo a funeral.”

I pushed the journal toward them, past the line of dice. “Look anyway.”

Wil didn’t reach for it. Sim did. His fingers brushed against the page I’d marked, one of the later ones where Herma’s writing began to slip sideways into gibberish and broken rhythm.

“I saw the knotwork log erased this morning,” I said. “Three terms gone. Herma’s seal gone too. And now one of his last notes is written on paper from the Arcane Bursar’s desk.”

Wil snorted. “What’s the theory? Hemme poisoned him mid-syllable? Brandeur sent a cursed fruit bowl?”

Sim didn’t smile. He turned another page.

“I’m not saying I know,” I said, my throat tight. “But something doesn’t fit. These are the last notes Herma left. They’re unfinished, cryptic, written like he meant to return to them. Now, just days after his death, they’re locked away, and there’s Bursar ink on one of the final pages.” 

Sim looked up, his voice careful now. “Kvothe, do you think you’re following a thread?” He hesitated, clearly trying not to hurt me. “Or are you just trying not to let go?”

That hit harder than I expected. Not cruel. True.

But I said, softly, “Maybe both.”

Wil leaned back, arms crossed. “When does anything ever fit together for you? Honestly, half your cleverest ideas come from stuffing square pegs into round holes.”

“I know, but this,” I began, my mind tangled and my eyes never leaving the journal. “This knot is different.”

Wil groaned. “This is going to end well. So very well.”
