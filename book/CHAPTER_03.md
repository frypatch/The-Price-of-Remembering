# CHAPTER 3.

## THE SILENT TOLL.


THE ARCHIVES BREATHED around me, quiet and heavy.

I had claimed a narrow table beneath an arched window, where the light of last bell spilled through old glass like liquid amber. It wasn’t warm. Not really. But it had the suggestion of warmth, the way that word might rest on your tongue even when the fire’s gone out.

Around me, I had built a small fortress of books. “Numbered Names.” “Feyda’s Legacy.” “Child-Charms of the Western Vale.” “Hashar’s Curtain.” Each one a brick, placed carefully, lovingly. A scholar might have called it comparative research. A sympathist might have said I was drawing lines, looking for patterns. But the truth was simpler, I was chasing shadows. Shadows wearing old names. 

I was three pages deep into “Numbered Names”, working my way through a tangled verse of Mid-Shaldaic couplets, when Ambrose Jakis stepped into view. His robes were a bright Vintish red that did nothing to flatter the smug tilt of his lips and his hair was swept back with such deliberation it looked like it cost gold. His scent arrived before he did, cloying with rose oil and a hint of whatever powder arrogance is made from.

“Re’lar Kvothe,” he said, stopping three paces from my chair. “Conquering the Archives one aisle at a time, I see.”

He stood and waited, the silence pacing beside him. When I did not rise to the bait, he shifted, like a man seeking dry ground.

“You’ve laid siege to half a shelf of Shaldaic ramblings.” He gestured at my nest of books, his mouth twisting in a mockery of admiration. “What is it now? Lullabies for restless children, or researching adolescent fancies?”

I did what any man does when he finds a roach loose on his dinner plate. I set my eyes hard upon my notes, as if, by staring, I could burn a hole straight through the page.

He leaned closer, “Still charmingly tight-lipped. Must be exhausting, all that silent brilliance.”

He reached forward, slow as disdain, and rested his hand on the open copy of “Numbered Names”.

I looked up at last.

“I'm using that,” I said evenly.

Ambrose smiled. Not the gentle smile of courtesy. Not a smile at all, really. It showed his teeth, tops and bottoms, without any kind of fattening on the upper cheeks. “And yet you did not check it out,” he said, producing a small vellum slip sealed in the red wax of the Arcane Bursar’s desk.

“Filed properly. Logged and stamped,” he said, placing it atop the book like a winning hand in a game I hadn’t known we were playing. “Dreadfully unfortunate, isn’t it? Your claim only counts if you mark it.”

“You did this on purpose.”

“Of course I did. It makes me ill to see Edema Ruh fingers paw at the University’s archive. Scrivs gave years to those shelves, turning dust into order. And you stroll in, thinking you deserve what they built.”

He withdrew the book, gently, lovingly, like he meant to mount it on a plaque. He turned a few pages as he did, pretending to skim.

I reached for “Feyda’s Legacy” instead, but Ambrose just tutted and lifted the carved leather from the stack. “Ah, this one too, I’m afraid.”

He turned to go.

“I still need those,” I said.

He paused. The set of his shoulders softened, just slightly. As if he carried a private joke, and it warmed him from within.

“Then you’ll need to learn to place requests like grown students do. Hunching over some scrolls doesn’t just make them yours. This isn't a midden.”

He walked away then. Not quickly. Not reluctant. He moved with the resolve of a draccus deciding to cross a grove. A thick silence crept in behind him. The sort of hush that settles after something has been stolen, expertly and unfairly, leaving behind no course for the victim to remediate.

Renner’s eyes flicked up. Just for a moment. Then, back to the ledger, as if nothing had happened. As if watching justice slip past had become commonplace, stitched into the quiet rhythm of his days. Rules over reason. Rules over mercy. Always the rules. 

I let my fingers rest on the empty space where “Numbered Names” had been. The wood was cool under my skin, the empty space colder still.

I hadn’t logged the books. It was as simple and foolish as that. But part of me hadn't wanted anyone knowing what old shadows I was chasing. That's the trouble with pride. It blinds you to foxes wearing silk smiles.

My hands shook. 

Before I could still them, the bell rang.

Not the brassy chime of a class change. Not the shrill peal of fire or folly.

The Iron Bell. Low. Slow. The breath of stone lungs. The heartbeat of an old god turning over in sleep.

I froze.

The knell did not falter. It did not echo and fade. It did not merely pass through the hall. It filled it, slow and steady as a tide. Students stilled. A scroll slipped from one hand and drifted down. A book found its place on the shelf, without thought or reason. Even Renner looked up, caught by the sound.

The Iron Bell sang only one note.

Mourning.

The true kind. The kind that folds the world in half, sharp as a closing book.

### * * *

The stillness of the Eolian that evening was unnatural. The tavern, usually alive with song, music, and the clink of mugs, sat dulled and subdued. Even the chandeliers seemed dimmer, their waxy yellow glow hesitant to reach far into the corners.

No one played Tinker Tanner. Not tonight. Not even badly.

Wil, Simmon, Mola, Fela, and I sat in our usual corner booth. It was not the shadowed hollow of comfort it normally was. The air hung too still. The old wood of the table felt cold beneath our hands. We had the hollowed feel of a song struck just off key.

Classes had been canceled for the span, an occurrence that rarely happened. The official notice mentioned administrative shortages, reassignment of duties, and necessary meetings. But everyone knew better. The University never made space for grief unless it absolutely had to. And the absence of Herma, who had been kind, measured, and constant, left a gap you could hear in the silence of the bells.

Wil raised his mug first, the gesture slow and deliberate. “To Herma,” he said, voice coarse with something quieter than anger, sharper than sorrow. He didn’t look at us. He stared down into the dark ale like it might answer a question he’d forgotten how to ask.

“To a steady hand,” Sim added, gentle-voiced. His drink paused halfway to his mouth, hand hovering. A flicker of tension in his jaw. He drank anyway.

“To a good man,” Mola said. She kept her eyes on the candle as she did, the flame reflected in the smooth gloss of her gaze.

Fela took a long breath. Her voice, when it came, was soft and dry at the edges. “To a proper Chancellor,” she murmured. “Whatever that means now.”

I hadn’t meant to say anything at all. But their words hung like threads waiting to be tied. To add nothing would’ve made me feel like the knot had slipped.

“To Herma,” I echoed, though the words left my mouth without weight. They were air across a cold mirror.

We drank.

A bottle arrived a few minutes later, silent and unannounced. The dark glass was shaped like a hushed thought, the cork already split. It was Vintish brandy, the good kind, not something a student could afford even on a lucky term.

The barkeep nodded toward the bar without being asked.

Deoch stood there, glass in hand, not drinking. He wasn’t watching us directly, but he was keenly aware of everything. He hadn’t known Herma. Their circles barely touched. But he knew us. Knew the air of loss when it hung around a table. He sent the bottle and left us alone. That was just like him.

We poured careful portions. No one spoke for a while.

The candle between us leaned in its wax cradle, its flame thinner than usual, as if mourning had its own gravity. My eyes fell to its uncertain flicker, how it trembled without wind.

“Men and their walls,” Fela said at last, not looking at anyone in particular.

Wil’s brow furrowed. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“Exactly what it means,” she said. “You toast like someone marking names off a list. Neither of you could wring a feeling into words if your life depended on it.”

Wil opened his mouth, then closed it again. Sim raised both eyebrows but kept wisely silent.

Fela met my eyes and didn’t blink. “You usually mean your words. When you speak, Kvothe, people look up. That toast? I barely heard it.”

I let my fingertips graze the side of the glass. Cool, smooth, untouched. I could have fashioned a clever retort. Some right-sounding answer to feather over the cracks. But I didn’t have any. Not the good kind.

“He was the first man at the University who didn’t treat me like I’d arrived by accident,” I said. “He remembered my name before I earned it. That sounds small, but it wasn’t. Not to me.”

Mola pressed her fingers briefly to my wrist. It grounded me more than I expected.

“He gave me the kind of silence that doesn’t shame you. You know the kind. The silence teachers use when they want to give you space to think instead of to apologize. He knew how to tie meaning with empty thread.”

No one interrupted. Nothing needed to be added.

We sat there for a while in a shared silence. Thats when the raw words came. The ones I couldn't give voice.

The truth is, I hate losing things. More than that, I’m terrified of it.

Herma’s death wasn’t just a loss. It was a knot left half-tied, a pattern begun but never finished. And I couldn’t stop picking at it. My mind circled back, over and over, searching for the thread that might unravel it all and make it make sense.

It’s a sickness, I think, this need to fix what was never my doing. The ache to lay the world flat on the table and name its shape when all it wants to do is twist. I don’t know how to grieve gently. So instead, I dig.

I didn’t speak those thoughts aloud.

But I think Fela saw something in my face. That open, unfinished part of me I work so hard to bury.

She didn’t say anything else. She just looked at me like she understood that my toast, while incomplete, was as much as I could give. And then she looked away, letting the moment fold itself down like a letter no longer needing to be read. 

### * * *

The morning after Herma’s death arrived without ceremony. No sunbeam haloed the windows. No birds dared etch the silence. I woke late, liver aching and mouth filled with the taste of last night’s sorrow. Brandy had blunted the edge, but grief had filed it sharp again while I slept.

I didn’t rise at first. I lay still beneath the thin blanket in Anker’s attic room, watching the ceiling crack along a lazy seam, the timber beam above me like a distant road I could never walk.

Memory returned slowly, not as a rush of pain but as a damp cold seeping into the joints. Herma’s face appeared, not with the sharpness brought by illness, but softened in the half-light of recollection. A crooked smile came to mind, along with the way he tilted his head when puzzling over a knot, as if it might reveal its secret if he waited long enough. There was also the rare, warm patience he offered to students who deserved none of it, myself among them.

He was gone. And the world had the gall to keep turning.

### * * *

A week had passed and Herma was still gone.

I crossed the stone span to the Archives just before second bell, my best coat pulled high against a lazy wind. The sun blinked through thin morning mist, gray-gold and washed out.

Inside, the quiet felt different today. It wasn't reverent exactly, just simply drained. The scent of parchment and dust seemed thinner. The tension in the air no longer tingled with curiosity. Instead, it hung slack and unstrung, like a harp left untuned.

I offered a nod as I passed the Scrivs’ counter. Only Renner was on duty this early, his eyes bracketed with weariness. He gave a perfunctory tilt of the head that might once have been a greeting.

My feet turned of their own accord, leading me through the lower stacks, down a marble-inset hallway I’d come to know well. I moved without thinking, the same way your hand finds half-forgotten scars.

There had been a table toward the back, half-hinged and warped with water beneath its varnish, where Herma and I had spent three measured afternoons parsing knot-codes from the Barony of Okorran. We had argued, though gently, about redundancies of vowel-float and semantic inversions embedded in the spacing.

I reached it again. Still warped, still quiet.

Even the dust hadn’t been disturbed.

No record slips. No books left waiting for re-shelving. And most telling: no coils of knotted rope.

My blood ticked louder in my ears.

At the nearest counter, I waited until a scriv noticed me. She had short-cropped hair and the pallor of someone raised on too much lamp-light.

“Excuse me,” I said as easily as I could manage. “I was working with several Yllish texts, mostly unbound knotworks sourced from the Maer’s third donation. They were shelved on level three, alcove M-fifteen. Are they being restored or are they available?”

She barely looked up. “That collection's been recategorized.”

I blinked. “Recategorized?”

“Administrative reassignment,” she clarified, brushing a ribbon of ink from her hand. “Now under the direct supervision of Archivist Brandeur. Restricted until further notice.”

“Restricted?” I tried, casually enough. “I’ve been working with those individual entries for over three terms. I’ve cited them in three separate admissions reviews.”

She shrugged, the motion small and unconcerned. “Doesn’t change the classification. Anything under Archivist supervision requires written clearance.”

That word again. Clearance. A thin veil over countless locked doors.

“And the ledger slips?” I asked, voice just a shade cooler. “There should be records of each knotwork’s circulation.”

“That’s strange,” she frowned scanning the logbook. “Your name should be here. Was there another designation you used?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I had used my name. I logged them distinctly and consistently. Herma had even approved one under his seal for an independent study admission. That knotwork had been my connection to him these final months. And it had been erased.

I didn’t thank the scriv. I walked away before my mouth could come to any ill-considered conclusions.

### * * *

Back in the upper stacks, I took a different stair. Not the eastern one, where the marble had worn soft in the center.

I needed to clear my head.

Instead, I found my fingers tracing ink along familiar paper. Not a journal, not exactly. Just a slim folio, always tucked beneath the table’s left shelf. Barely hidden, never sealed.

It wasn’t formally protected because it wasn’t meant to be. It wasn’t an archive. It was something more private, a kind of working sketchbook that Herma used to warm his hands against the cold of translation. It was a half-scribed place to stretch the mind before working real knots.

More than once, I’d watched him undo loops, scrawl alternate glyphs, knot half-thought riddles like seeds scattered in dry soil. It was equal parts study and scribble. The kind of space only someone serious about understanding ever bothers to make. 

He always left it here, half-buried beneath old parchment, like a bookmark between afternoons. Not forgotten. Just routine. A kind of ritual. His way of picking up the rhythm of last week so his hands wouldn’t wander today. I’d left margin-scribbles there myself before. Questions beside his thoughts, left like seeds. He never answered. Not in ink.

Then, on the third-to-last page, there is a single, complex glyph. It was knotted in both forward syntax and reversed. It was repetitive. Redundant. Wrong.

I stared at it. The longer I looked, the less sense it made. And yet it wanted something. Not speech, certainly. But structure. It echoed a kind of purposeful confusion. The way a cipher sometimes doubles back and eats its own tail.

“You left me pieces,” I whispered to the page.

And then I noticed it, a smudge. Faint. Not ink, not quite. A grayish crescent was tucked beneath one glyph’s loop, perhaps a thumbprint. It was not Herma’s. The shape was too thick, too firm.

I turned the journal gently in the light.

Branded parchment.

One watermark, just visible, ghosted along the page. It was the Arcane Bursar's own. If ink could tell you who owned it, this page would shout of Hemme's gatekeeping.

My fists itched. I could feel something slithering into shape, but I had too few pieces.

“You were never just failing,” I said to the ghost of Herma’s hand. “Were you?”

Nothing in the book answered. But absence speaks too. 

Outside, bells marked third bell with a softer voice. On this side of grief, I heard it differently. There was a pattern here. I could feel it tug, taut as breath. And I wasn’t letting it slip.

### * * *

The common room at Anker’s was quieter than usual, with no bellowing arguments over dice and no half-drunken students trying to rewrite ballads louder than the competition. Just the low hum of voices and the knock of tankards on old oak. Life moving forward, as it always does.

Simmon saw me first. He raised a hand from our corner table, two fingers lifted in lazy greeting. Wil was already seated across from him, arms crossed over his chest, one boot up on the bench. A small pile of dice sat between them, the evidence of a game grown tired or one interrupted.

I slid onto the bench beside Sim and laid Herma’s folio carefully on the table.

Wil gave it a glance. “We drinking tonight or introducing bedtime reading to the betting table?”

“He’s brooding,” Sim murmured too gently to sting.

“I’m,” I stopped. No clever deflection came. “There’s something wrong.”

They both looked at me.

Wil’s brow lifted. Sim’s creased with concern.

“Of course there is,” Wil said, leaning back. “The Chancellor’s dead. Hemme’s stomping around with a seal he doesn’t deserve, and Brandeur’s pretending to matter.”

Sim cut in before I could answer. “Whatever you think’s crawling under the floorboards, Kvothe, it isn’t going to undo a funeral.”

I pushed the journal toward them, past the line of dice. “Look anyway.”

Wil didn’t reach for it. Sim did. His fingers brushed against the page I’d marked, one of the later ones where Herma’s writing began to slip sideways into gibberish and broken rhythm.

“I saw the knotwork log erased this morning,” I said. “Three terms gone. Herma’s seal gone too. And now one of his last notes is written on paper from the Arcane Bursar’s desk.”

Wil snorted. “What’s the theory? Hemme poisoned him mid-syllable? Brandeur sent a cursed fruit bowl?”

Sim didn’t smile. He turned another page.

“I’m not saying I know,” I said, my throat tight. “But something doesn’t fit. These are the last notes Herma left. They’re unfinished, cryptic, written like he meant to return to them. Now, just days after his death, they’re locked away, and there’s Bursar ink on one of the final pages.” 

Sim looked up, his voice careful now. “Kvothe, do you think you’re following a thread?” He hesitated, clearly trying not to hurt me. “Or are you just trying not to let go?”

That hit harder than I expected. Not cruel. True.

But I said, softly, “Maybe both.”

Wil leaned back, arms crossed. “When does anything ever fit together for you? Honestly, half your cleverest ideas come from stuffing square pegs into round holes.”

“I know, but this,” I began, my mind tangled and my eyes never leaving the journal. “This knot is different.”

Wil groaned. “This is going to end well. So very well.”
