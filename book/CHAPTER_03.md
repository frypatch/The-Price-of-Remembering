# CHAPTER 3

## THE SILENT TOLL  

THE ARCHIVES BREATHED around me, quiet and heavy.

I had claimed a narrow table beneath an arched window, where the light of last bell spilled through old glass like liquid amber. It wasn’t warm. Not really. But it had the suggestion of warmth, the way the word home might rest on your tongue even when the fire’s gone out.

Around me, I had built a small fortress of text: "Numbered Names", "Feyda’s Legacy", "Child-Charms of the Western Vale", and "Hashar’s Curtain"—each book like a brick placed carefully, lovingly. A scholar might have called it comparative research. A sympathist might have said I was triangulating a pattern. But the truth was simpler—I was chasing shadows wearing old names.

I was three pages deep into "Numbered Names", working my way through a tangled verse of Mid-Shaldaic couplets, when Ambrose Jakis stepped into view. His robes were a bright Vintish red that did nothing to flatter the smug tilt of his smile. His hair was swept back with such deliberation it looked like it cost gold. His scent arrived before he did, cloying with rose oil and a hint of whatever powdered arrogance is made from.

“Ah,” he said, stopping three paces from my chair, “Re’lar Kvothe. Colonizing the Archives one aisle at a time, I see.”

He glanced over the spread of books, fake-impressed. “You’ve set siege to half a shelf’s worth of Shaldaic ramblings. Researching lullabies or recruiting ancient demons?”

I did what any man does when he finds a roach skittering across his dinner plate, I studied my notes hard enough to drill through the page.

He leaned closer, “Still charmingly tight-lipped. Must be exhausting, all that silent brilliance.”

He reached forward, slow as disdain, and rested his hand on the open copy of "Numbered Names".

I looked up at last.

“I'm using that,” I said evenly.

Ambrose smiled. Not the polite kind—the kind that shows teeth. “Yet you didn't checked it out,” he said, producing a small vellum slip sealed in the red wax of the Arcane Bursar’s desk. “Filed properly. Logged and stamped.”

He placed it delicately atop the book like a winning hand in a game I hadn’t known we were playing. “Dreadfully unfortunate, isn’t it? These are public volumes. Your claim only counts if you mark it.”

“You did this on purpose.”

“Of course I did. I’m not fond of watching your grubby fingers smear ink across more than your allowance of parchment.”

He withdrew the book, gently, lovingly, like he meant to mount it on a plaque. He turned a few pages as he did, pretending to skim.

I reached for "Feyda’s Legacy" instead, but Ambrose just tutted and lifted the carved leather from the stack. “Ah, this one too, I’m afraid.”

He turned to go.

“I still need those,” I said.

He paused. The set of his shoulders softened, just slightly—as if relaxing into a private joke.

“Then you’ll need to learn to place requests like grown students do. Hunched over your scrolls doesn’t make them yours. This is a library, not a midden.”

He walked off—not quickly, not triumphantly. Just… efficiently. Like a man who’d wiped the table and saw no reason to linger over the crumbs.

Velvet silence settled around me again. The kind of quiet that follows after something’s been taken, wrongfully and well.

Scriv Renner’s eyes flicked up for a moment. Then, back to the ledger. As if nothing had happened. As if watching justice slip by had become routine. As if the rules always mattered more than the spirit of them.

I let my fingers rest on the empty space where "Numbered Names" had been. The wood was cool under my skin, the empty space colder still.

I hadn’t logged the books. Simple as that—or as foolish. But part of me hadn't wanted anyone knowing what old shadows I was chasing. That's the trouble with pride. It blinds you to foxes wearing silk smiles.

My hands shook. 

Before I could still them, the bell rang.

Not the brassy chime of a class change. Not the shrill peal of fire or folly.

The Iron Bell. Low. Slow. The breath of stone lungs. The heartbeat of an old god turning over in sleep.

I froze.

The second peal came heavier than the first—closer this time. It didn’t pass through the hall; it filled it. Students stilled. One dropped a scroll. Another placed a book back on the shelf without meaning to. Even Renner looked up.

The Iron Bell sang only one note.

Mourning.

The true kind—that folds the world in half, sharp as a closing book.

### * * *

The stillness of the Eolian that evening was unnatural. The tavern that usually hummed with life—brimming with song, singing strings, and clinking mugs—sat dulled and subdued. Even the chandeliers seemed dimmer, their waxy yellow glow hesitant to reach far into the corners.

No one played Tinker Tanner. Not tonight. Not even badly.

The five of us—Wil, Simmon, Mola, Fela, and I—sat in our usual corner booth. It wasn’t the shadowed hollow of comfort it normally was. The air hung too still. The old wood of the table felt cold beneath our hands. We had the hollowed feel of a song struck just off key.

Classes had been canceled for the span—a rare closure. The official notice spoke of administrative shortage, reassignment of duties, necessary meetings. But everyone knew better. The University didn’t make space for grief unless it had no choice. And the absence of Herma—kind, measured, constant—left a gap you could hear in the silence of the bells.

Wil raised his mug first, the gesture slow, deliberate. “To Herma,” he said, voice coarse with something quieter than anger, sharper than sorrow. He didn’t look at us. He stared down into the dark ale like it might answer a question he’d forgotten how to ask.

“To a steady hand,” Sim added, gentle-voiced. His drink paused halfway to his mouth, hand hovering. A flicker of tension in his jaw. He drank anyway.

“To a good man,” Mola said. She kept her eyes on the candle as she did—flame reflected in the smooth gloss of her gaze.

Fela took a long breath. Her voice, when it came, was soft and dry at the edges. “To a proper Chancellor,” she murmured. “Whatever that means now.”

I hadn’t meant to say anything at all. But their words hung like threads waiting to be tied. To add nothing would’ve made me feel like the knot had slipped.

“To Herma,” I echoed, though the words left my mouth without weight. They were air across a cold mirror.

We drank.

A bottle arrived a few minutes later, silent and unannounced. Dark glass, shaped like a hushed thought, the cork already split. Vintish brandy—the good kind. Not something a student could afford on even a lucky term.

The barkeep nodded toward the bar without being asked.

Deoch stood there, glass in hand, not drinking. Not watching us directly. Just… aware. He hadn’t known Herma. Their circles barely touched. But he knew us. Knew the air of loss when it hung around a table. He sent the bottle and left us alone. That was just like him.

We poured careful portions. No one spoke for a while.

The candle between us leaned in its wax cradle, its flame thinner than usual, as if mourning had its own gravity. My eyes fell to its uncertain flicker, how it trembled without wind.

“Men and their walls,” Fela said at last, not looking at anyone in particular.

Wil’s brow furrowed. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“Exactly what it means,” she said. “You toast like someone marking names off a list. Neither of you could wring a feeling into words if your life depended on it.”

Wil opened his mouth, then closed it again. Sim raised both eyebrows but kept wisely silent.

Fela met my eyes and didn’t blink. “You usually mean your words. When you speak, Kvothe, people look up. That toast? I barely heard it.”

I let my fingertips graze the side of the glass. Cool, smooth, untouched. I could have fashioned a clever retort. Some right-sounding answer to feather over the cracks. But I didn’t have any. Not the good kind.

“He was the first man at the University who didn’t treat me like I’d arrived by accident,” I said. “He remembered my name before I earned it. That sounds small, but it wasn’t. Not to me.”

Mola pressed her fingers briefly to my wrist. It grounded me more than I expected.

“He gave me the kind of silence that doesn’t shame you. You know the kind. The silence teachers use when they want to give you space to think instead of to apologize. He knew how to tie meaning with empty thread.”

No one interrupted. Nothing needed to be added.

We sat there for a while in a shared silence. Thats when the raw words came. The ones I couldn't give voice.

The truth is, I hate losing things. More than that, I’m terrified of it.

Herma’s death wasn’t just a loss. It was a knot left half-tied, a pattern begun but never finished. And I couldn’t stop picking at it. My mind circled back—again and again—looking for the thread that might unravel it all and make it make sense.

It’s a sickness, I think, this need to fix what was never my doing. The ache to lay the world flat on the table and name its shape when all it wants to do is twist. I don’t know how to grieve gently. So instead, I dig.

I didn’t speak those thoughts aloud.

But I think Fela saw something in my face. That open, unfinished part of me I work so hard to bury.

She didn’t say anything else. She just looked at me like she understood more than I’d spoken. And then she looked away, letting the moment fold itself down like a letter no longer needing to be read. 

### * * *

The morning after Herma’s death arrived without ceremony. No sunbeam haloed the windows. No birds dared etch the silence. I woke late, liver aching and mouth filled with the taste of last night’s sorrow. Brandy had blunted the edge, but grief had filed it sharp again while I slept.

I didn’t rise at first. I lay still beneath the thin blanket in Anker’s attic room, watching the ceiling crack along a lazy seam, the timber beam above me like a distant road I could never walk.

Memory came slowly, not like a rush of pain but a damp cold that seeped into the joints. Herma’s face: not in the clarity of illness, but in the half-light of memory. A crooked smile. The way he tilted his head when parsing a knot like it might whisper if you gave it long enough. The rare, warm patience he'd offer students who deserved none of it. Myself among them.

He was gone. And the world had the gall to keep turning.

### * * *

A week had passed and Herma was still gone.

I crossed the stone span to the Archives just before second bell, my best coat pulled high against a lazy wind. The sun blinked through thin morning mist, gray-gold and washed out.

Inside, the quiet was different today. Not reverent, exactly. Just... drained. The scent of parchment and dust felt thinner. The tension in the air no longer tingled with curiosity but hung, slack and unstrung, like a harp left untuned.

I passed the Scrivs’ counter, offered a nod. Only Tempi was on duty this early, his eyes bracketed with weariness. He gave a perfunctory tilt of the head that might once have been a greeting.

My feet turned of their own accord, leading me through the lower stacks, down a marble-inset hallway I’d come to know well. I moved without thinking, the same way your hand finds half-forgotten scars.

There had been a table toward the back—half-hinged, warped with water beneath its varnish—where Herma and I had spent three measured afternoons parsing knot-codes from the Barony of Okorran. We'd argued, if gently, about redundancies of vowel-float and semantic inversions embedded in the spacing.

I reached it again. Still warped, still quiet.

Even the dust hadn’t been disturbed.

No record slips. No books left waiting for re-shelving. And most telling: no coils of knotted rope.

My blood ticked louder in my ears.

At the nearest counter, I waited until a scriv—not Renner—noticed me. She had short-cropped hair and the pallor of someone raised on too much lamp-light.

“Excuse me,” I said as easily as I could manage. “I was working with several Yllish texts—mostly unbound knotworks sourced from the Maer’s third donation. They were shelved on level three, alcove M-fifteen. Are they being restored or—?”

She barely looked up. “That collection's been recategorized.”

I blinked. “Recategorized?”

“Administrative reassignment,” she clarified, brushing a ribbon of ink from her hand. “Now under the direct supervision of Archivist Brandeur. Restricted until further notice.”

“Restricted?” I tried, casually enough. “I’ve been working with those individual entries for over three terms. I’ve cited them in three separate admissions reviews.”

She shrugged, the motion small and unconcerned. “Doesn’t change the classification. Anything under Archivist supervision requires written clearance.”

That word again. Clearance. A thin veil over countless locked doors.

“And the ledger slips?” I asked, voice just a shade cooler. “There should be records of each knotwork’s circulation.”

“That’s strange,” she frowned scanning the logbook. “Your name should be here… unless there’s another designation you used?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I had used my name. I logged them—distinctly, consistently. Herma had even approved one under his seal for an independent study admission. That knotwork had been my connection to him these final months. And it had been erased.

I didn’t thank the scriv. I walked away before my mouth could come to any ill-considered conclusions.

### * * *

Back in the upper stacks, I took a different stair. Not the eastern one, where the marble had worn soft in the center.

I needed to clear my head.

Instead, I found my fingers tracing ink along familiar paper. Not a journal, not exactly. Just a slim folio, always tucked beneath the table’s left shelf. Barely hidden, never sealed.

It wasn’t formally protected because it wasn’t meant to be. It wasn’t an archive. It was something more private: a kind of working sketchbook that Herma used to warm his hands against the cold of translation. A half-scribed place to stretch the mind before working real knots.

More than once, I’d watched him undo loops, scrawl alternate glyphs, knot half-thought riddles like seeds scattered in dry soil. It was equal parts study and scribble. The kind of space only someone serious about understanding ever bothers to make. 

He always left it here—half-buried beneath old parchment, like a bookmark between afternoons. Not forgotten. Just routine. A kind of ritual. His way of picking up the rhythm of last week so his hands wouldn’t wander today. I’d left margin-scribbles there myself before. Questions beside his thoughts, left like seeds. He never answered. Not in ink.

Then, on the third-to-last page: a single, complex glyph. Knotted in both forward syntax and reversed. Repetitive. Redundant.

Wrong.

I stared at it. The longer I looked, the less sense it made. And yet it wanted something. Not speech, certainly. But structure. It echoed a kind of purposeful confusion. The way a cipher sometimes doubles back and eats its own tail.

“You left me pieces,” I whispered to the page.

And then I noticed it: a smudge. Faint. Not ink, not quite. A grayish crescent tucked beneath one glyph’s loop—a thumbprint, perhaps. Not Herma’s. The shape was too thick, too firm.

I turned the journal gently in the light.

Branded parchment.

One watermark, just faint enough: The Arcane Bursar. If ink could smell like a signature, this page reeked of Hemme’s gatekeeper.

My fists itched. I could feel something slithering into shape—but I had too few pieces.

“You were never just failing,” I said to the ghost of Herma’s hand. “Were you?”

Nothing in the book answered. But absence speaks too. 

Outside, bells marked third bell with a softer voice. On this side of grief, I heard it differently. There was a pattern here. I could feel it tug, taut as breath. And I wasn’t letting it slip.

### * * *

The common room at Anker’s was quieter than usual: no bellowing arguments over dice, no half-drunken students trying to rewrite ballads louder than the competition. Just the low hum of voices and the knock of tankards on old oak. Life moving forward, as it always does.

Simmon saw me first. He raised a hand from our corner table, two fingers lifted in lazy greeting. Wil was already seated across from him, arms crossed over his chest, one boot up on the bench. A small pile of dice sat between them, the evidence of a game grown tired or one interrupted.

I slid onto the bench beside Sim and laid Herma’s folio carefully on the table.

Wil gave it a glance. “We drinking tonight or introducing bedtime reading to the betting table?”

“He’s brooding,” Sim murmured too gently to sting.

“I’m—” I stopped. No clever deflection came. “There’s something wrong.”

They both looked at me.

Wil’s brow lifted. Sim’s creased with concern.

“Of course there is,” Wil said, leaning back. “The Chancellor’s dead. Hemme’s stomping around with a seal he doesn’t deserve, and Brandeur’s pretending to matter.”

Sim cut in before I could answer. “Whatever you think’s crawling under the floorboards, Kvothe, it isn’t going to undo a funeral.”

I pushed the journal toward them, past the line of dice. "Look anyway."

Wil didn’t reach for it. Sim did. His fingers brushed against the page I’d marked—one of the later ones, where Herma’s writing began to slip sideways into gibberish and broken rhythm.

“I saw the knotwork log erased this morning,” I said. “Three terms gone. Herma’s seal gone too. And now one of his last notes is written on paper from the Arcane Bursar’s desk.”

Wil snorted. “What’s the theory? Hemme poisoned him mid-syllable? Brandeur sent a cursed fruit bowl?”

Sim didn’t smile. He turned another page.

“I’m not saying I know,” I said, throat tight. “But something doesn’t fit. These are the last notes Herma left—half-finished, cryptic, measured like he meant to come back to them. And now they’re locked away, just days after his death. With Bursar ink on one of the final pages.”

Sim looked up, his voice careful now. “Kvothe… do you think you’re following a thread? Or… are you just trying not to let go?”

That hit harder than I expected. Not cruel. True.

But I said, softly, “Maybe both.”

Wil leaned back, arms crossed. “When does anything ever fit together for you? Honestly, half your cleverest ideas come from stuffing square pegs into round holes.”

“I know,” I said, eyes never leaving the journal. “But this—this knot is different.”

Wil groaned. “Oh, this will end *so well.*”
