# CHAPTER 50.

## THE PROPER WAY.


THE WORLD SHIFTED between one breath and the next, and Kvothe stood surrounded by the ruins of the Waystone Inn. Broken timber and shattered stone spread outward from where he stood to the waystones that encircled the wreckage of his careful trap. Above, the night sky of the mortal world stretched familiar and cold, its stars fixed in their proper places, following their proper paths.  

His shaed hung heavy across his shoulder, bundled and knotted into a makeshift sack. Inside the dark fabric, something shifted that was no bigger than a pair of gloves but reeked of iron.  

Bast and Chronicler stood frozen among the settling dust. The inn had collapsed not three heartbeats ago, and now Kvothe stood in the center of the ruins as if he had always been there. As if the falling timber had simply passed through him like rain through smoke.  

Chronicler’s mouth worked soundlessly, his mind trying to reconcile what his eyes insisted they had seen. The stories were one thing. Seeing it was another thing entirely.  

Bast began to clap. Slow. Deliberate. Like the beat of a ritual drum. Understanding dawned across his face, the expression of someone who has just witnessed a magic trick so audacious that admiration is the only possible response.  

“You magnificent bastard,” Bast said, shaking his head with something between disbelief and delight. Then his eyes found the bundled shaed and a wild grin spread across his face. “Took him to the Fae, where the third time always pays for all.”  

“Later,” Kvothe said, raising what remained of his left hand. The gesture was small but final. “First, there is one more thing that needs to be properly done.”  

Chronicler swallowed hard, finally finding his voice. “Where are we going?”  

“Crazy Martin’s,” Bast muttered, falling into step behind Kvothe.  

### * * *  

The moon hung low in the sky, yellow and swollen. The road to Martin’s farm stretched ahead, a ribbon of packed earth in the darkness.  

They walked in silence. The shaed swayed with each of Kvothe’s steps, growing heavier not in weight but in what it meant. In what his friends would see when he unwrapped it. In what they would know about him after.  

Martin’s hovel squatted at the edge of his fallow field like a toad made of timber and mud. Above, smoke leaked from the chimney in a thin, tired line. The windows glowed dim with dying coals, and somewhere inside, a dog barked once and fell silent.  

Kvothe knocked three times, each impact deliberate as a heartbeat.  

They waited. The silence that followed had the particular quality of a house deciding whether to answer. Behind them, Chronicler shifted his weight from foot to foot. Bast stood perfectly still, the way he did when he was listening to things no one else could hear.  

The door opened just wide enough to show a slice of Martin’s face, weathered as old leather. “Tehlu’s teeth and toes,” he began, his voice rough with sleep. “Do you know what hour it is?”  

His words died as his eyes found the bundled shaed. His gaze tracked from the dark stains seeping through the fabric to Kvothe’s face, and what he saw there made him step back, pulling the door wide.  

“So,” Martin said, and the word was perfectly flat. “It’s done then.”  

“As done as such things can be,” Kvothe replied, stepping inside without invitation. The shaed brushed against the doorframe, leaving a mark on wood that was never quite clean.  

Martin bolted the door behind them with movements born of paranoia. Three locks. Three bars. Three curses muttered under his breath.  

“Is everything ready?” Kvothe asked, though it wasn’t really a question.  

Martin’s laugh was dry as old leaves. “Been ready for over a year now. Maybe longer. Time gets strange when you’re waiting for the world to end.” He moved to the center of the room, his footsteps careful around certain boards that would complain. Then, glancing at the bundled shaed again, he said, “Seems I prepared for more than was needed. But then, better too much room than too little.”  

The room smelled of smoke and sweat and dust. Martin knelt beside a threadbare rug, grasped its edge, and pulled. Beneath lay two trapdoors set flush with the floor, their iron hinges eaten with rust but still strong.  

“Stand back,” Martin said, though no one had moved close. He took an iron gaff from the wall, the kind used to haul heavy things from dark places, and hooked it through a ring set in the wood. His shoulders bunched. His teeth showed yellow in the lamplight.  

The doors opened like a wound to darkness that waited with the patience of a grave.  

Martin lit a torch from the fireplace and held it over the pit. Stone walls descended into darkness. At the bottom lay wood stacked in careful rows. Ash and elm and rowan. At the center sat an iron wheel, grey and waiting.  

Chronicler leaned forward to peer inside. “I know what this is.” Then, looking back at Kvothe, he said, “Let me tell you what to do.”  

Bast continued, falling into the old rhythm. “Dig a pit that’s ten by two.”  

Kvothe finished it, his voice carrying harmonics it hadn’t in years. “Ash and elm and rowan too.”  

The words were promise and prophecy, recipe and ritual, ending and beginning all at once.  

Martin moved to the wall and returned with a ladder. “I’ll lower it down.”  

Kvothe picked up the bundled shaed. “No,” he said quietly. “This is mine to finish.”  

He moved to the edge of the pit and looked down at the waiting wood and iron. Then he took the ladder in his good hand and began his descent, the bundle tucked under his other arm.  

Behind him, Bast and Chronicler stood at the edge, watching. Martin held the torch steady, casting light into the darkness below.  

At the bottom, Kvothe bent over the stacked wood, relieved at how little he could actually see. He unwrapped the shaed slowly, letting its contents roll onto the ash and elm and rowan. Two hands, grey and still. Nothing more. Nothing less.  

He fumbled to arrange them beneath the iron wheel, then stood and looked up at the three faces watching from above. In the torchlight, their expressions were unreadable.  

“It’s done,” he called up, his voice echoing slightly off the stone walls.  

Then he began to climb.
