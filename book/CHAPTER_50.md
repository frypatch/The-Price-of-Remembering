# CHAPTER 50.

## THE PROPER WAY.


WHEN KVOTHE STEPPED through the jagged wound where the Waystone Inn’s wall had been, the world welcomed him back with teeth. The air bit sharp and cold, tasting of autumn’s death and winter’s promise. Behind him, through that impossible doorway, the Fae breathed its strange purple light into the mortal world, but already the gap was closing, the stones remembering their proper shape, their proper place. Soon there would be nothing but a scar to mark where two worlds had kissed and parted.  

The burlap sack hung heavy on his shoulder, its weight more than mere flesh and bone could account for. It pulled at him the way old sins pull at conscience, the way finished things pull toward earth. Inside, something shifted wetly, and the smell that escaped was iron and ending, sweet decay and bitter triumph all mingled into one.  

Bast stood waiting in the ruins of what had been the inn’s foundation, his eyes wide as wounds. Chronicler stood beside him, still clutching his satchel as if it might anchor him to sanity. They looked at Kvothe the way men look at lightning after it strikes too close, with wonder and wariness in equal measure.  

“Kvothe,” Bast began, and his voice cracked on the name like a boy’s voice breaks on the edge of manhood.  

Kvothe raised what remained of his left hand. The gesture was small, but it carried the weight of mountains, the finality of closed doors. “Later,” he said, and the word fell into the space between them like a stone into deep water. “There will be time enough for questions when this is properly done.”  

He shifted the sack higher on his shoulder. Inside, things settled with a sound like wet leaves beneath November rain.  

Bast’s nostrils flared. His pupils contracted to slits, then dilated wide as midnight. “Tehlu’s burning beard,” he whispered, the oath escaping him like steam from a kettle. “Is that what I think it is?”  

“It is what it needs to be,” Kvothe said. His green eyes had gone dark as old forests, dark as the spaces between stars where no light has ever been. “Nothing more. Nothing less.”  

Chronicler swallowed hard, his throat working like a man trying to speak around stones. “Where are we going?”  

“To finish what was started.” Kvothe turned toward the road, his movements careful and deliberate as ritual. Each step was measured, weighted, considered. The sack swayed with his motion, keeping time like a pendulum counting down to judgment. “To Martin’s. To the proper way of things.”  

“Crazy Martin,” Bast muttered, falling into step behind them. His voice tried for levity and failed, landing somewhere between nervous and numb. “Of course. Because this night needed more madness.”  

### * * *  

The moon hung low and bloated in the sky, yellow as old bone, casting shadows that seemed to reach for their feet with eager fingers. The road to Martin’s farm was a ribbon of packed earth that knew their footsteps, remembered their weight. Each bootfall echoed in the stillness, creating a rhythm that was almost music, almost prayer.  

The sack grew heavier with each step. Not in weight, perhaps, but in meaning. In finality. In the way that carried things grow heavier the closer you come to setting them down for the last time.  

Martin’s hovel squatted at the edge of his fallow field like a toad made of timber and rage. Smoke leaked from the chimney in a thin, bitter line, writing messages in the air that only the wind could read. The windows glowed dim as dying coals, and somewhere inside, a dog barked once and fell silent.  

Kvothe knocked three times, each impact deliberate as a heartbeat. The sound carried in the still air, seeming to echo longer than wood and knuckle should allow.  

Time stretched. Contracted. Breathed.  

The door opened just wide enough to show a slice of Martin’s face, weathered as old leather, suspicious as a miser counting coins. “Tehlu’s teeth and toes,” he began, his voice rough with sleep and sourness. “Do you know what hour—”  

His words died as his eyes found the sack. His gaze tracked from the dark stains seeping through the burlap to Kvothe’s face, and what he saw there made him step back, pulling the door wide.  

“So,” Martin said, and the word was flat as a blade laid against a whetstone. “It’s done then.”  

“As done as such things can be,” Kvothe replied, crossing the threshold without invitation. The sack brushed against the doorframe, leaving a mark that would never quite wash clean.  

Martin bolted the door behind them with movements born of long practice and longer paranoia. Three locks. Three bars. Three words muttered under his breath that might have been prayer or curse or both.  

“Is everything ready?” Kvothe asked, though it wasn’t really a question.  

Martin’s laugh was dry as August dust. “Been ready for over a year now. Maybe longer. Time gets strange when you’re waiting for the world to end.” He moved to the center of the room, his footsteps careful to avoid certain boards that creaked accusations. “Though I’d hoped never to see you carrying that particular burden.”  

The room smelled of smoke and sweat and the peculiar bitterness that comes from hope held too long, like wine turned to vinegar in the bottle. Martin knelt beside a threadbare rug that had seen better decades, grasped its edge, and pulled. Beneath lay two trapdoors set flush with the floor, their iron hinges eaten with rust but still strong, still willing.  

“Stand back,” Martin said, though no one had moved close. He took an iron gaff from the wall, the kind used to haul heavy things from dark places, and hooked it through a ring set in the wood. His shoulders bunched. His teeth showed white in the lamplight.  

The doors opened like a mouth, like a wound, like a promise finally kept.  

Below, darkness waited with the patience of the grave.  

Martin lit a torch from the fireplace, and the flames revealed what the darkness had been keeping. The pit was deep enough that the bottom seemed to exist in another country, another time. The walls were lined with stones so old their surfaces had gone smooth as water, as skin, as the inside of bells that have rung so long they’ve worn away their own voices.  

At the bottom, barely visible in the torch’s wavering light, lay wood. Ash and elm and rowan, stacked with the careful precision of a pyre waiting for its sacrifice. And at the center, patient as judgment, sat the wheel.  

Iron, every inch of it. Not bright iron or dark iron, but the grey iron that comes from stars, from the hearts of mountains, from the forges that existed before men knew fire had a name. It was a simple thing, unadorned, unbeautiful. But it had weight beyond its substance, presence beyond its form. It was a wheel that had been waiting to turn since before the world learned how to count its days.  

Chronicler made a sound in his throat, not quite word, not quite whimper. His fingers twitched toward his satchel, reaching for pen and ink and the comfort of recording rather than experiencing.  

Bast’s tail lashed once, twice, then went still. When he spoke, his voice was soft as silk, sharp as glass. “I know what this is.”  

“Then you know why it must be done,” Kvothe said. He set the sack down with the careful reverence reserved for holy things and horrible things and things that are both at once.  

The silence that followed had texture, had weight. It pressed against their ears like deep water, like the pause between lightning and thunder when the world holds its breath to see what will break.  

Martin cleared his throat, the sound harsh as a saw through old wood. “The words, then. You remember the words?”  

Kvothe’s smile was a terrible thing, beautiful and broken as a sword that’s tasted too much blood. “How could I forget? They’ve been carved into my bones since before I knew I had bones to carve.”  

Chronicler stepped forward, and his voice was steady as his hands were not. “Let me tell you what to do.”  

The words hung in the air like a challenge, like an invitation, like the first note of a song everyone knows but no one wants to sing.  

Bast continued, his words falling into the ancient rhythm, the cadence that was older than the stones, older than the wheel, older than the darkness waiting below. “Dig a pit that’s ten by two.”  

Kvothe finished it, his voice carrying harmonics that shouldn’t exist in human throat, resonances that made the flames dance and the shadows cower. “Ash and elm and rowan too.”  

The words were promise and prophecy, recipe and ritual, ending and beginning all at once. They settled into the air like stones into water, sending ripples through the fabric of what was real and what was merely true.  

Martin moved to the wall and returned with a ladder, old wood bound with older rope, each rung worn smooth by the grip of desperate hands. “I’ll lower it down,” he said, though his eyes said other things, older things, things that had no words in any language spoken by living men.  

Kvothe picked up the sack again, cradling it almost gently now, the way a mother holds a child she knows she must give away, the way a musician holds an instrument he knows will play its last song.  

“No,” he said, and the word was soft as smoke, final as the sound a candle makes when it goes out. “This is mine to finish.”  

He moved to the edge of the pit, and for a moment he stood there, balanced between the light above and the darkness below, between the world of men and the older world that waited beneath, patient as stone, hungry as fire.  

Then he took the ladder in his good hand and began his descent, carrying his burden down into the darkness that had been waiting since the world was young, toward the wheel that would turn one last time, toward the ending that was really just another kind of beginning.  

Behind him, the torch flames bent as if bowing.  

Or perhaps they were only saying goodbye.
