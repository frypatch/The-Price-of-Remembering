# CHAPTER 35.

## THE PRICE OF LOYALTY.


THE ROPES GROANED as they drew the mangonel’s arm back for another blow. I leaned against the cold stone, my shoulder burning, my breath thin and shallow. Every motion sent a sharpness through me, like broken glass grinding bone to splinters. I wanted to move. I wanted to act. But my body had grown treacherous, trembling beneath the weight of pain and weariness.  

Then came the horns.  

The sound split the air, sharp and cold, rising above the crackle of fire and the cries of the dying. I turned toward the arrow slit, the movement tearing at my wound. Below, the battlefield writhed, a shattered tide of bodies and blood. Fascino’s men, wild in their jeering and slick with slaughter, froze as the sound washed over them.  

Knights broke through their lines, their armor flashing with sapphire and ivory light. Two banners flew in the vanguard. The first was House Calanthis, red and gold, dragged through the mud and blackened by soot. The second banner twisted my stomach with its weight: sapphire and silver, the sigil of the Maer Alveron.  

I watched as the Maer’s forces carved through Fascino’s ranks, not with fury but with a cold, clean precision. Dagon was there, the Maer’s dark-eyed captain, and his saber sang as it swept through Fascino’s neck. The body crumpled. The head struck the ground. Baron Jakis fled on foot, his fine cloak torn, his hands bloody, his eyes wide with a desperate kind of fear. The Maer followed, not quickly, but with the certainty of a thing that cannot be stopped. His voice rang out, heavy as iron.  

“You thought to poison me. You thought that would be enough.”  

Jakis did not die quickly.  

The room filled with a hollow quiet when the screams ended. It pressed against the walls and settled in our bones. Roderick’s voice cracked into that silence. “Raise the gate!” he called, brittle with hope. His words felt sharp against my skin, wrong in a way I could not name. When the portcullis lurched upward, I heard my own voice rise.  

“Wait.”  

No one waited.  

The Maer’s men entered the courtyard in a flood of steel and shadow. Alveron dismounted, his knights spreading behind him like the wings of some slow, inevitable storm. He began to climb the tower, step by step. Each footfall struck the stone and echoed upward. Each sound demanded attention, and we had no choice but to listen.  

The boots came first, slow and steady, rising toward us one measured step at a time.  

### * * *

Alveron entered with a measured purpose. His knights flowed around him, filling every shadow in the room until there was nowhere left untouched by their presence. The Maer’s expression was cool as an autumn lake. Whatever kindness I had once glimpsed in his sharp features was gone, not hidden but erased, as if it had never been there at all. He carried no pretense of warmth. He had no need.  

Roderick stumbled forward, his hand outstretched, the silver seal of his house catching a faint sliver of light. “Lerand,” he said, his voice bright with forced delight. “You came. You saved me.”  

Alveron stopped him with a single word. “No.”  

It was not shouted. It did not need to be. The sound of it struck Roderick as if it had been a blade. The Maer’s next words came quieter, but with a certainty that brooked no misunderstanding. “I didn’t come for you.”  

The room pressed close with silence. Only the soft creak of leather stirred the air as Alveron drew his sword. Roderick stood motionless. He had seen his death. The streak of crimson that followed was almost delicate, a thin bloom that traced his throat as his crown toppled free, rolling away as though eager to be rid of him.  

Auri screamed. She broke forward, trembling and desperate.  

“No!” Sim’s voice rang sharp, cutting through the air.  

I caught her first. My fingers wrapped around her wrist, though they shook as she struggled against me. Sim had stepped forward, his face bloodless but set in iron. He grabbed for a weapon, finding a fallen sword. The hilt sat awkwardly in his grip, but his hands did not waver.  

“For all your cleverness,” Alveron said, turning his gaze upon me, “you chose to bind yourself to this drowning wreck of a king. Did you believe you would be spared the harvest of what you have sown?”  

He gave Dagon a nod so slight it could have been mistaken for a breath. The captain lunged. I raised my hand and spoke the Name of Fire, ready for the struggle I had always known it to be. But there was no struggle. What came forth was fury, unchained and wild. It struck Dagon full in the chest, flames twisting around his armor, searing his face until it became a thing unrecognizable. His screams did not sound human.  

But the price was steep. The fire left me hollow. I crumpled against the wall, my breath shuddering in my chest. Dagon, though burning, did not fall.  

### * * *

Sim stepped into the gap before I could move.  

“Stay back!” he roared, his voice sharp enough to make the air flinch. The knights hesitated. For a breath, I feared he would freeze as well. But then his feet shifted, steady and certain, as though the ground itself had given him leave to stand.  

The Name settled in him. It did not break like thunder, nor did it whisper like a secret. But there was a change in how he gripped the borrowed blade. A quiet truth. As though the sword had always known his hand.  

Iron.  

His focus narrowed into a single, unforgiving point. Sim’s first strike came swift and sure, bending his opponent’s blade as if guided by weight beyond his own strength. He stepped into the arc of the swing, moving with a precision too perfect to be chance, as though another hand steadied his own.  

The knights stumbled under Sim’s fury, their iron bowing to his will. He cut through one. Then another. Each step forward stripped the softness from his face, carving it into something harder. With every strike, his shoulders bowed, his limbs trembled, his body burning coin for coin the price his mind demanded.  

Wil surged to his side, his axe heavy in his hands, cleaving into a knight who dared too close. “Sim!” he bellowed, voice ragged. “Fall back!”  

But Sim did not hear him.  

I called to him too, but my voice was a pale thing against the storm of his focus. He never saw the knight closing from his blind side. The blade slid into him, cutting deep, and the sound of it was soft and awful. Like something vital giving way.  

Wil roared, a wordless sound that shook the air. He charged, his axe carving through two men with reckless force. But it was not enough. Too many blades turned on him, piercing from every side. He fell beneath them, his body folding into the earth like a toppled stone.  

Sim fell first. He turned toward me, eyes wide and wild, lips moving in a soundless plea. Whatever word he meant to give me was already lost, caught somewhere between his breath and mine, fading before it ever reached the world.  

### * * *

Heat flooded through me. Not a burning heat, but sharp and cold, like the edge of a blade scraping along bare nerve.  

I spoke the Name of the Wind, though this was not the wind I had called before. This one came raw and untamed. It came hungry. It came violent.  

It screamed through the room, slicing through Alveron’s knights as if they were no more than parchment. Dagon stood within it, his body blackened and burned, yet still he refused to fall. The wind clawed at him, tearing at what little strength remained.  

The storm faltered only when I did. My legs tangled beneath me, my Alar splintered from within, no longer able to bear its own weight. I never saw Dagon’s lunge. His saber found my chest before my eyes could follow. My breath left me in a soundless gasp. That gasp was all I had left.  

But in the hollow of my ear, Auri’s voice whispered, faint and fragile. “Kvothe, live. Please.”  

And then, as I fell, the Wind was the only thing that remained.
