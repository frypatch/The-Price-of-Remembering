# CHAPTER 35.

## THE PRICE OF LOYALTY.


THE SMOKE STILL ROSE from where the mangonel had been, black and thick against the sky. I leaned against the cold stone, my shoulder burning, my breath shallow. Every motion sent a sharpness through me, like broken glass grinding bone to splinters.  

Below, Fascino’s men dragged timbers from the wreckage, lashing them into ladder frames. Others whirled grappling hooks through the air. And where the mangonel’s stone had torn the inner parapet, some tested the rubble, seeking holds.  

Sim stood at the top, exposed, his eyes sharp on the broken wall below. He watched them probe the wreckage, testing paths. “There,” he said, pointing to where the mangonel’s blow had carved a rough line upward. “That’s the only path up.” He gestured to the nearest guard. “If anyone makes it past that point, drop them. Make every arrow count.”  

The guard nocked his bow.  

Behind them the first hook cleared the wall. Wil pounced, catching it before it could bite. He hurled it back down, chain whipping through the air.  

Another hook struck and held. Wil grabbed his axe, reversed it, and brought the hammer poll down. Sparks flew. Metal rang. By the third blow the link had cracked, and with the fourth the hook fell slack.  

Down below, fresh soldiers poured into the courtyard, their armor unmarked and bright. They had not spent themselves against our oil and arrows. Then Fascino’s voice rang out. “A barony to the first man who brings me the crown! Land and title for the hand that takes the tower!”  

They were relentless. We had no oil left to pour. They were rested. We could barely stand. They came in waves. Our arrows could be counted on two hands. The math was simple.  

Then came the horns.  

The sound split the air, sharp and cold, rising above the crackle of fire and the cries of the dying. I made it over to the arrow slit, the movement tearing at my wound. Below, the battlefield writhed, a shattered tide of bodies and blood. Fascino’s men, wild in their jeering and hungry for slaughter, froze as the sound washed over them.  

Knights broke through their lines, their armor flashing with sapphire and ivory light. Two banners flew in the vanguard. The first was House Calanthis, red and gold, dragged through the mud and blackened by soot. The second bore sapphire and silver, the sigil of the Maer Alveron.  

Relief flooded through my mind. The Maer had a change of heart. Reinforcements had arrived. We were saved.  

I watched as the Maer’s forces carved through Fascino’s ranks in cold, clean precision. Dagon was there, the Maer’s dark-eyed captain, and his saber sang as it swept through Fascino’s neck. The body crumpled. The head struck the ground. Beyond, Baron Jakis fled on foot, his fine cloak torn, his hands bloody, his eyes wide with a desperate kind of fear. The Maer pursued him with a hunter’s patience, closing ground with each stride. His voice rang out across the courtyard. “You thought to poison me. You thought that would be enough.”  

Jakis did not die quickly. The Maer took his time the way a cat takes its time with a mouse already caught.  

The room filled with a hollow quiet when the screams ended. It pressed against the walls and settled in our bones. Roderick’s voice cracked into that silence. “Raise the gate!” he called, raw with hope. But something about this felt wrong in a way I could not name. When the portcullis lurched upward, I heard my own voice rise.  

“Wait.”  

But no one waited.  

### * * *  

The boots came first, slow and steady, rising toward us one measured step at a time.  

Alveron entered, his knights flowing in behind him, filling every shadow in the room until none were left untouched. The Maer wore the calm that no man should carry with bloodshed. Whatever kindness I had once glimpsed in his sharp features had been scoured away, leaving only purpose.  

Roderick stumbled forward, his hand outstretched, the silver seal of his house catching a faint sliver of light. “Lerand,” he said, his voice breaking with relief. “You came. You saved me.”  

Alveron stopped him with a single word. “No.”  

The room pressed close with silence. Only the soft creak of leather stirred the air as Alveron drew his sword. Roderick stood motionless. He had seen his death. The streak of crimson that followed was almost an afterthought, a thin bloom that traced his throat as his crown toppled free, rolling away as though eager to be rid of him.  

Auri screamed. She broke forward, trembling and desperate.  

My body moved before my mind could think. My hand shot out and caught her wrist. Pain bloomed white and hot through my wounded shoulder, tearing loose some of Auri’s careful stitches. Something gave way deep in the socket, and a gasp caught in my chest. My arm fell limp.  

Auri froze and stared at the blood spreading through my shirt. Her face went from grief to recognition to horror in the space between heartbeats. “No,” she whispered. “No, no.” Her small hands fluttered to my shoulder. “You’ve broken what I made proper.” Her fingers probed the wound with practiced certainty even as tears carved clean lines through the dust on her face. “The stitches have run away. And the pieces inside. They were all lined up so nicely.”  

Alveron’s gaze followed Auri’s voice and found me. “Kvothe,” he said, shaking his head. “For all your cleverness, you chose to bind yourself to this drowning wreck of a king.”  

He gave Dagon a nod so slight it could have been mistaken for a breath.  

Before anyone could think, Wil stepped forward. Axe in hand, he placed himself between us and the tide like a wall made of flesh and fury. At Dagon’s command they surged forward, and Wil answered with a wordless sound that shook the air. His axe bit deep into the first knight. Then the second. He fought like a man who knew his ending and walked toward it with open eyes.  

The guards saw him fighting. Something broke in them then. Not courage exactly. But the same understanding that death was coming whether they fought or cowered, and at least fighting meant they could choose how they met it.  

A guard to Wil’s left drove his blade through a knight’s neck. Another blocked a strike meant for Wil’s blind side. Sim grabbed a fallen sword, his grip awkward, and held himself at the edges with the clumsy terror of a man who had never wanted to hold a sword. Men grunted and cursed and bled.  

Too many blades found Wil, piercing from every side. He fell beneath them, his body folding to the floor like a toppled stone.  

The guards fought on. One fell. Then another. They died buying moments with their blood. Precious moments. And as they fell, the chaos pulled Sim deeper. The knights pressed forward. Death came wearing steel and certainty.  

Then something changed.  

The Name settled in him like a key finding its lock. It did not break like thunder, nor did it whisper like a secret. But there was a change in how he gripped the blade. A quiet truth. As though the sword had always known his hand.  

“Feralthalien.”  

His next strike came swift and sure, bending his opponent’s blade as if guided by weight beyond his own strength. The knights stumbled under his fury, their iron bowing to his will. He cut through one. Then another. Each step forward stripped the softness from his face, carving it into something harder.  

The last guard fell. Sim stood alone.  

His focus narrowed into a single, unforgiving point. With every strike his shoulders bowed, his limbs trembled, his body burning coin for coin the price his mind demanded.  

I reached then with naked desperation. I begged the Wind. I begged Tehlu. I begged anything that might be listening in the empty air to please, please hear me.  

But the captain’s blade was already moving. It slid into Sim, cutting deep. The sound was soft and awful. Like something vital giving way.  

Sim turned toward me as he fell, eyes wide and wild, lips struggling to form words. But the Wind had already come, and it swallowed up whatever he meant to give me. Then it tore through the room like a thing gone mad. Knights lifted from their feet and struck stone with sounds like breaking branches. Dagon stumbled backward, his boots scraping, but somehow kept his footing against the gale.  

The storm faltered only when I did. My legs tangled beneath me, my Alar splintered from within. I never saw Dagon’s lunge. His saber found my chest before my eyes could follow. My breath left me in a soundless gasp. That gasp was all I had left.  

But in the hollow of my ear, Auri’s voice whispered, faint and fragile. “Kvothe, live. Please.”  

The world tilted. My feet found the edge where the parapet had been. Where stone ended and sky began. The doorway that once led to the outer wall now opened onto nothing. A mouth gaping over the abyss. My balance fled. The tower released me like a secret it could no longer hold.  

And then, as I fell, the Wind was the only thing that remained.
