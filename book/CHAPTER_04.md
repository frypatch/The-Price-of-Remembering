# CHAPTER 4.

## EARS IN THE WIND.


I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I expected to find in Herma’s guilder. Only that Mola had examined it during the autopsy and set it aside because it didn’t sit right. It had passed their testing and been declared sound, but I needed something they hadn’t tried. Something unorthodox. A moneylender’s livelihood depended on knowing true metal from false. If anyone in Imre had alchemical reagents for testing coins, reagents sensitive enough to reveal what Mola’s conventional testing had missed, it would be Devi.  

Two knocks, and she opened her door.  

“Kvothe. Always a delight,” she said, her smile already half a dare. “Have you come to lose more of your dignity? Or merely to bask in my natural radiance?”  

“Neither,” I said, stepping inside. The windowless rooms pressed close, lit by sympathy lamps that cast familiar shadows across her collection of books. Cinnamon and cardamom laced the air, dulling the butcher shop below to a faint undertone. “Though if you’re offering radiance, I’ll take a double helping.”  

She rolled her eyes but didn’t stop smiling. “Come in then, sweet boy. Sit. What charming trouble have you brought to brighten my doorstep?”  

Over the spiced tea she offered, I explained what I needed. Alchemical reagents that could reveal traces conventional testing might miss. I listed off the metals that composed the grams I’d made, working from my theory that a guilder’s construction couldn’t be so different.  

“Ah,” she said after I finished. “So we’re experimenting, are we? With borrowed alchemy at midnight? How convincingly not suspicious of you.”  

I laughed. “Devi, you’ve always been my preferred source of suspicious materials.”  

She considered the shelf with performative thoughtfulness, then selected several vials. Clear ones. Amber ones. Something dark as old honey. “These should show you what you’re looking for. If there’s anything to find.” She arranged them on the table between us. Five in all. “You’ll owe me. A favor. One of my choosing.”  

I hesitated. “That sounds vague.”  

“Vagueness, dear Kvothe, is the spice of life. You’ll say yes, of course.”  

“And if I don’t?”  

“Then I’ll never make you tea again,” she said brightly. “And you’ll be forced to rot in ignorance, alone and unloved.”  

I kept my smile in place, though my gut twisted at the idea of owing her anything undefined. Still, something in the set of her eyes made it feel less than a trap. She wasn’t hunting me. Not today. So I took the vial, bowing slightly. “You are insufferable.”  

“Oh, darling.” Her smile widened. “But you suffer so beautifully.”  

### * * *  

That night at the Medica’s side entrance, with the vials sitting cold against my hip, I met Wil and Sim. Once inside, sympathy lamps glowed softly, casting long shadows across polished surfaces. All around us, the silence pressed in.  

“This is ridiculous,” Wil muttered, shoulders tight, as if the Medica’s clinical smell made his skin crawl. “Weeks of good decisions. Gone with one bad idea and more bad wine.”  

“Two skins of wine,” Sim corrected. He kept his arms tight against his sides, as if trying to contain a panic that threatened to spill over. “And when Arwyl skins us alive, don’t expect me to defend either of you.”  

“No one’s catching us,” I murmured, feigning confidence. Ahead of us, nestled against the wall, sat Herma’s guilder among the other examined effects from the autopsy. The case was plain glass and brass, easy to overlook. Motioning for Wil to stand watch, I stepped forward to crouch in front of the case. My fingers fidgeted restlessly as I examined the lock. All clean lines and precise metalwork. Simple. Practical. The sort of design that promised to be more difficult than it looked.  

“You’re sure about this?” Sim said in a voice that was as close to a shout as a whisper could be.  

“Truthfully?” I said, working the lock as I spoke. I didn’t look up, and my voice was quieter than I felt. “Not remotely.”  

But I’d opened worse. My fingers found the pins, and the lock gave way, its well-oiled mechanism yielding without so much as a click. I lifted the lid. The guilder looked ordinary at first glance. A flat lead disc with sygaldry stamped into its surface. Plain. Utilitarian. The sort of token any full arcanist carried. When I picked it up, the numbing sensation was there, like it had been when I’d held Abenthy’s guilder. But its protective bite was blunted, and didn’t grow as I held it longer. Underneath, my fingers detected what felt like a crackled surface, but when I turned it over the back was smooth and unremarkable.  

I tipped one of Devi’s vial over the guilder. Slow and careful. The liquid slipped across the sygaldry, winding into every groove. At first, nothing. The air held still. Then, salt crystals crawled along lines, thin and sharp, glittering like frost.  

Behind me, Sim inhaled. His breath caught. “Is that normal?”  

“No,” I said, wiping the guilder clean with a jeweler’s cloth from my pocket. “Devi’s reagent tests for metallic corruption. Foreign elements that shouldn’t be there.” I held the guilder to the light. “A proper guilder would show clear channels, maybe a faint residue from use. Not this. These crystals mean something was introduced to the sygaldry.”  

“Done?” Wil whispered. He watched the hallway, shoulders tight, each breath drawn shallow.  

“Yes,” I said, fitting the lock back into place with a final click. My hands worked faster than my mind, the question weighing on me. Who could have done this? And, worse, who would? The sabotage was clever. Elegant, even. I tried not to leap to conclusions. Tried not to let suspicion settle. But this had been deliberate, and it wasn’t over.  

### * * *  

Later, Mola would tell me she never looked up. She simply sat at her usual place beneath the cracked stair lamp, pretending to read a Medicae botanica text like she wasn’t listening for footfalls she had no business hearing. That she had kept a calm face and just mouth pressed her lips into the kind of line usually reserved for uncooperative patients.  

“I didn’t lie,” she had told me. “I just redirected Ezra when he started his rounds early. I told him there was a misfiled note in the apothecary. There wasn’t, but it seemed wiser to put him somewhere else.”  

She didn’t say it just to justify herself. Mola never needed my approval, not since the day she saved my life in the Medica. But that night, she chose silence over certainty. That choice required more than courage. It called for quiet belief. She believed in me.  

### * * *  

The night was cold in the courtyard, the air crisp and unforgiving. Moonlight spilled unevenly over the cobblestones. The chill bit sharper after what we had seen.  

Wil leaned against the courtyard wall. “This stops here.”  

I didn’t respond right away. My fingers toyed with an edge of my cloak. I couldn’t settle my thoughts.  

“Kvothe, we’ve already gone too far,” Sim said, his hands buried deep in his pockets, his voice tight with worry. “Yes, something is definitely wrong. Something very wrong. But we need to bring this to the Masters. We have to.”  

“Hemme won’t admit to anything,” I said, the pieces fitting too well to ignore. “Men like him never do. But I don’t need his confession. I just need him to slip.”  

Sim glanced nervously at Wil. “We don’t even know it’s Hemme.”  

Wil nodded. “And what if it is? You trap him with clever words?”  

I gave him a staged smile. “Please, let me try. Give me three days of careful work. That’s all it will take. Careful work, and the right ears.”  

“Careful work?” Sim’s voice rose slightly. “Kvothe, this is dangerous.”  

“Three days,” Wil said, cutting through the protest, his gaze holding steady on me. “But after that, I’m done.”

The next afternoon, Brandeur’s measured monotone droned in the lecture hall, filling the air like bad music. He tinkered with theories too dry to spark interest, too dull to linger in memory. Most students stared blankly, their minds somewhere else entirely. I sat near the front, making certain my presence unspooled against his awareness like a snagged thread.

“Hemme might’ve thought this was clever,” I muttered, just loud enough to be heard. My lips brushed the words softly, almost to myself, though I chose them with care. “It seems so simple. But it’s always the cracks. Things slip there first.”

To his credit, Brandeur’s voice didn’t stumble midsentence, but the brief flicker of his eyes told me what I needed to know. Some threads, even careless ones, pulled tighter than others.

Hours later, I caught him moving across the cobblestones. His gait was sharp and purposeful, his steps cutting through the twilight gloom. He moved toward Hemme’s office. I trailed him at a distance, my own movements quiet as I made my way to the gargoyle fountain.

The night deepened around me, my breath curling faint in the cold as I crouched low beside the fountain. I reached out with my Alar and coaxed the overcurious wind to weave its thread. One side drifted toward Hemme’s shuttered office while the other slipped toward Kilvin's. Calling the wind was not force. It was seduction, a kind of charm you encouraged gently, as if leading a bird to your open hand. Slowly, I teased softness into firmness and murmured until it yielded.

Hemme’s voice rode the current first, sharp and clipped. “It was delicate work, nothing more. Not sabotage. A gentle nudge. Something no one should have noticed.”

Another voice, softer, less distinct. “And Herma?”

Hemme’s voice carried through the wall. “Herma was old.” There was a thread of exasperation in it, pulled thin. “This didn’t kill him. Time did. I only helped it along.”

The wind trembled. It slipped free of my words, and the voices dissolved into the night. Still, I had heard enough. My teeth clenched against the weight of it. Hemme’s confession was soft. Ordinary. But true. Herma hadn’t needed to die. I could only hope the current I had set loose would carry his words to Kilvin.

### * * *

The trial took weeks to wind its way into motion. Weeks where I made myself stay quiet, an unseen Cthaeh easing pieces into place while others bore the weight of suspicion. Kilvin carried the case where I could not, pulling together threads I’d left carefully loose behind me, his calm authority reshaping what I couldn’t touch directly.

When Hemme finally stood beneath the shadow of the Iron Law, I remained in the gallery, one face in a sea of quiet onlookers. Kilvin testified with grave simplicity, recounting a trail of evidence that pointed unmistakably toward tampering, and toward Hemme. Arwyl followed, dragging the room through his detailed reexamination of Herma’s body. Signs of malfeasance. Tiny, deliberate patterns.

It wasn’t the confession itself that struck Hemme down. It was the weight of too many threads woven against him, and the smallest fray in his infamous control. The records of materials purchased from the Artificery. The faint patterns in Herma’s decline. His accomplice’s silence. It was inevitable, like a rope drawn tight enough to strangle.

But even as the trial resolved, I found no satisfaction. Justice wasn’t sharp, not like guilt. It wasn’t clean. It was heavy and dull, something that settled slowly into grief’s hollow weight. I told myself it was enough, though I could not say for sure if I believed it.

What I know is this. I spent long nights awake, staring at the ceiling, chasing the thought. Wondering if I might have found it sooner. If I had tugged at the thread before it knotted. If it would have made a difference. If it would have mattered.
