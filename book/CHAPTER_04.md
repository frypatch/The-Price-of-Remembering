# CHAPTER 4

## EARS IN THE WIND  

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I expected to find in Herma's gram—only that Mola had called it off-key, broken in a way she couldn’t name. I needed some unorthodox help to see what her eyes had missed.

And so, my feet carried me to Devi's door. I hadn’t even knocked twice before she opened it.

“Kvothe,” she said, her smile already half a dare. “Always a delight. Have you come to lose more of your—” she paused, her grin curling like a hook “—rare and celebrated dignity? Or merely to bask in my natural radiance?” 

“Neither,” I said, stepping inside as the cinnamon warmth curled around my boots. “Though if you're offering radiance, I'll take a double helping.”

She rolled her eyes but didn’t stop smiling. “Go on then, sweet boy. What charming trouble have you brought to brighten my doorstep?”

I brought out the request casually, threading enough truth into it to pass for honesty.

“Ah,” she said after I finished. “So we’re experimenting, are we? With borrowed alchemy at midnight? How convincingly not suspicious of you.”

I smiled. “You’ve always been my preferred source of suspicious materials.”

She considered the shelf with performative thoughtfulness for a beat, took the vial, and let it catch the light.

“No coin,” she said. “No blood markers. Not for such a little thing. But you’ll owe me. A favor. One of my choosing.”

I hesitated. “That sounds vague.”

“Vagueness, dear Kvothe, is the spice of life. Consider it a seasoning I’ll sprinkle on at some future date. You’ll say yes, of course.”

“And if I don’t?”

“Then I’ll never make you tea again,” she said, bright and terrible. “And you’ll be forced to rot in ignorance, alone and unloved.”

I kept my smile in place, though my gut twisted at the idea of owing her anything undefined. Still, something in the set of her eyes made it feel less like a trap and more like a tally. She wasn’t hunting me. Not today. So I took the vial, bowing slightly. “You are insufferable.”

“Oh, darling.” Her smile widened. “But you suffer so beautifully.” 

### * * *

The Medica held its breath, the kind of silence that settles like a frost: sharp, brittle, waiting. The lanterns along the walls hissed faintly, their light shivering against polished wood and copper fixtures. Shadows stretched tall and narrow, moving like they had somewhere to be. The place felt uneasy, too quiet, even for a building meant to soothe the wounded.  

“This is ridiculous,” Sim hissed, as close to a shout as a whisper could be. He kept his arms tight against his sides, as if trying to contain the panic threatening to spill over. “Weeks of perfectly good decisions undone by one bad idea and more bad wine. I’m filing a grievance with the world.”  

“Two gallons of wine,” Wil corrected, his voice low and steady. Despite his calm, there was a purpose to his steps, the sharp sound of his boots betraying more effort than ease. “And when Arwyl skins us alive, rest assured, I’ll not say a word in your defense. You first, then him, then me.”  

“No one’s catching us,” I murmured, feigning confidence. My hands curled and uncurled at my sides, itching for work, aching to quiet the restless knot twisting in my chest.  

Ahead of us, nestled unremarkably against the wall, stood the gram’s display case, an unassuming rectangle of glass and brass. But as I approached, my skin prickled, a faint hum settling under my ribs. The air around it felt different, thicker, like the heartbeat of something watching. I crouched over the case, studying its lock: clean lines, utilitarian. Practical and precise. The sort of design that didn’t trust anyone who got too close.  

“You’re sure about this?” Sim muttered, a little too loud. His breath brushed against the back of my neck.  

“Honest answer?” I said, keeping my hands moving as I spoke. I didn’t look up. My voice was quieter than I felt. “Not remotely.”  

The lock gave way with a breath and a whisper, its mechanism yielding without so much as a groan. I lifted the lid, my hand slipping into the case like an afterthought, and the gram came free. It was perfect—symmetrical, polished, a device meant to endure—but wrong all the same. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but once I noticed it, I couldn’t unfeel it.  

I tipped Devi’s vial over the gram, a slow, deliberate tilt, careful as combing snarled strings. The alchemical liquid unfurled like golden smoke, slipping into the etched sigaldry. At first, nothing happened. Then came the reaction: hair-thin lines of jagged brightness creeping outward, sharp and deliberate as frost on a winter window.  

Sim inhaled sharply behind me. I could hear the panic hitching in his breath. “Is that... normal?”  

“No,” I said, though I felt like I was speaking from somewhere else. “It’s not natural. And it’s definitely not grief.”  

I swiped the gram clean, working fast and precise, leaving no trace of our meddling. My fingers moved quicker than my thoughts, already tugging at the edges of the question looming large before me: Who could have done this? And, worse, who would? The craftsmanship was clever. Elegant. Dangerous. Hemme’s name rose first in my mind, thorned and venomous.  

“Done?” Wil whispered.  

“Yes,” I said, fitting the lock back into place with a final click. My hands felt steady, my voice even, but inside, my blood ran far from calm. As we slipped back into the darkened halls of the Medica, a single thought emerged and settled low in my chest, heavy as an iron weight: this had been deliberate, and it wasn’t over.  

### * * *

The night was cold in the courtyard, the air crisp and unforgiving. Moonlight spilled unevenly over the cobblestones, pooling in alcoves where ancient gargoyles studied us with chipped and weathered eyes. The chill bit sharper after what we had seen.  

“This is where it stops,” Sim said at last. His voice was low, his hands buried deep in his pockets. He leaned against the courtyard wall, close but distant, like he desperately needed something solid. I could hear the weariness in his tone, a line stretched too far and trembling. “We don’t push this. We’ve already gone too far.”  

I didn’t respond right away. My fingers toyed with an edge of my cloak, as if they needed to move to keep from curling again into fists. My thoughts twisted, folding and refolding themselves like restless water beneath a frozen bank.  

“Hemme won’t admit to anything,” I said finally, each word sharp and distinct, like I’d spent hours shaping them. “Men like him never do. But I don’t need his confession. I just need him to slip.”  

“To slip,” Sim repeated, flat and unimpressed. His voice, so often warm, felt far away now. He lifted his head to look at me, his eyes searching for something in my face. “And then what? You want him to tumble down the stairs of your cleverness? When has that ever worked?”  

I gave him a faint smile, something quick and dishonest, already moving toward the shadows. “Carefully,” I said. “That’s all it will take. Careful work, and the right ears.”  

“That sounds like a terrible plan,” Wil said darkly, crossing his arms as he leaned against the fountain. “Leave Hemme’s name out of it. If you lose control, I won’t—”  

“Carefully,” I repeated before the rest of his threat could land.  

### * * *

Later, Mola would tell me she never looked up. She simply sat at her usual place beneath the cracked stair lamp, pretending to read a Medicae botanica text like she wasn’t listening for footfalls she had no business hearing. Her face calm, back straight, mouth pressed into the kind of line usually reserved for uncooperative patients.

She didn't stop us. That was the important part. She didn’t stop us. A single glance in the wrong direction, one question asked at the wrong time, and the whole thing would have collapsed like bad lungwork.

“I didn’t lie,” she told me, later still. “I just redirected Ezra when he started his rounds early. Told him there was a misfiled note in the apothecary. There wasn’t, but... well. Best not to let the archives argue with whatever’s left of a pulse.”

She didn’t say it just to justify herself. Mola never needed my approval, not since the day she saved my life in the Medica. But that night? She chose silence over certainty. That took more than courage—it took quiet belief. In me. In Herma. In what might still be uncovered if no one shut the door before we reached the threshold.

She didn’t write down what she saw. She didn’t even turn her head. But in that hush between lantern flickers, her presence held steady like the last safe breath before drowning.

The kinds of truths we found that night don’t get admitted to ledgers. But without Mola, we’d never have walked out on our own feet. We might not have walked out at all. 

### * * *

The next afternoon, Brandeur’s measured monotone droned in the lecture hall, filling the air like bad music. He tinkered with theories too dry to spark interest, too dull to linger in memory. Most students stared blankly, their minds somewhere else entirely. I sat near the front, making certain my presence unspooled against his awareness like a snagged thread.  

“Hemme might’ve thought this was clever,” I muttered, just loud enough to be heard. My lips brushed the words softly, almost to myself, though I chose them with care. “It seems so simple. But it’s always the cracks... things slip there first.”  

To his credit, Brandeur’s voice didn’t stumble midsentence, but the brief flicker of his eyes told me what I needed to know. Some threads, even careless ones, pulled tighter than others.  

Hours later, I caught him moving across the cobblestones—his gait sharp and purposeful, his steps cutting through the twilight gloom. He moved toward Hemme’s office. I trailed him at a distance, my own movements quiet, the gargoyle fountain my destination.  

The night deepened around me, my breath curling faint in the cold as I crouched low beside the fountain. I reached out with my Alar, coaxing the overcurious wind to weave its thread, one side toward Hemme’s shuttered office and the other towards Kilvin's. Calling the wind wasn’t force; it was seduction, the kind of charm you coaxed gently, like leading a bird to your open hand. Slowly, I teased softness into firmness, murmuring until it yielded.  

Hemme’s voice rode the current first, sharp and clipped: “It was delicate work, nothing more. Not sabotage. A gentle correction. Something no one should have noticed.”  

Another voice, softer, less distinct: “And Herma?”  

“Herma was old,” Hemme said, and the edge in his voice cut cold. “This didn’t kill him. Time did. I just... moved the clock forward.”  

The wind trembled, slipping free of my words, and with it, the voices dissolved into the night. But I’d heard enough. My teeth clenched against the weight of it. Hemme’s admission was quiet, almost mundane, but it shaped the air around me like a chord struck low and long.  

### * * *

The trial took weeks to wind its way into motion. Weeks where I made myself stay quiet, an unseen Cthaeh easing pieces into place while others bore the weight of suspicion. Kilvin carried the case where I could not, pulling together threads I’d left carefully loose behind me, his calm authority reshaping what I couldn’t touch directly.  

When Hemme finally stood beneath the shadow of the Iron Law, I remained in the gallery, one face in a sea of quiet onlookers. Kilvin testified with grave simplicity, recounting a trail of evidence that pointed unmistakably toward tampering, and toward Hemme. Arwyl followed, dragging the room through his detailed reexamination of Herma’s body. Signs of malfeasance. Tiny, deliberate patterns.  

It wasn’t the confession itself that struck Hemme down. It was the weight of too many threads woven against him, and the smallest fray in his infamous control. The records of materials purchased from the Artificery. The faint patterns in Herma’s decline. His accomplice’s silence. It was inevitable, like a rope drawn tight enough to strangle.  

But even as the trial resolved, I found no satisfaction. Justice wasn’t sharp, not like guilt. It wasn’t clean. It was heavy and dull, something that settled slowly into grief’s hollow weight. I told myself it was enough, though I could not say for sure if I believed it. 

What I do know is that I spent many sleepless wondering if I could have found it earlier… if I’d pulled the thread sooner… would it have mattered?
