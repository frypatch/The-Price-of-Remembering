# CHAPTER 4

## EARS IN THE WIND

I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I expected to find in the Chancellor’s gram. Only that Mola had called it off-key, broken in a way she could not name. I needed help, something unorthodox. Eyes that might see what hers had missed. Ears attuned to secrets strung quiet and strange, humming just beneath the surface.

And so, my feet carried me to Devi's door. I hadn’t even knocked twice before she opened it.

"Kvothe. Always a delight." She said, her smile already half a dare. "Have you come to lose more of your rare and celebrated dignity? Or merely to bask in my natural radiance?"

“Neither,” I said, stepping inside as the cinnamon warmth curled around my boots. “Though if you're offering radiance, I'll take a double helping.”

She rolled her eyes but didn’t stop smiling. “Go on then, sweet boy. What charming trouble have you brought to brighten my doorstep?”

I brought out the request casually, threading enough truth into it to pass for honesty.

“Ah,” she said after I finished. “So we’re experimenting, are we? With borrowed alchemy at midnight? How convincingly not suspicious of you.”

I laughed. “Devi, you’ve always been my preferred source of suspicious materials.”

She considered the shelf with performative thoughtfulness for a beat, took the vial, and let it catch the light.

“No coin,” she said. “No blood markers. Not for such a little thing. But you’ll owe me. A favor. One of my choosing.”

I hesitated. “That sounds vague.”

“Vagueness, dear Kvothe, is the spice of life. Consider it a seasoning I’ll sprinkle on at some future date. You’ll say yes, of course.”

“And if I don’t?”

“Then I’ll never make you tea again,” she said, bright and terrible. “And you’ll be forced to rot in ignorance, alone and unloved.”

I kept my smile in place, though my gut twisted at the idea of owing her anything undefined. Still, something in the set of her eyes made it feel less like a trap and more like a tally. She wasn’t hunting me. Not today. So I took the vial, bowing slightly. “You are insufferable.”

“Oh, darling.” Her smile widened. “But you suffer so beautifully.”

### * * *

Silence filled the Medica, as if the building itself were holding its breath right along with us. Lanternlights hissed at the walls, flickering over polished wood, glinting off copper, glancing off glass. Shadows stretched themselves long and narrow across the floor, slipping away as if they, too, did not belong. The hush pressed in around us. It was too quiet, too careful. We stood where we ought not to stand, and even the air seemed to notice, as if the Medica was waiting for someone to find us out.

“This is ridiculous,” Sim hissed, as close to a shout as a whisper could be. He kept his arms tight against his sides, as if trying to contain the panic threatening to spill over. “Weeks of perfectly good decisions undone by one bad idea and more bad wine. I’m filing a grievance with the world.”

“Two gallons of wine,” Wil corrected, his voice low and steady. Despite his calm, there was a purpose to his steps, the sharp sound of his boots betraying more effort than ease. “And when Arwyl skins us alive, rest assured, I’ll not say a word in your defense. You first, then him, then me.”

“No one’s catching us,” I murmured, feigning confidence. My hands curled and uncurled at my sides, itching for work, aching to quiet the restless knot twisting in my chest.

Ahead of us, nestled unremarkably against the wall, stood the Chancellor's gram in the Medica’s display case. Plain glass, plain brass, easy to overlook. I told myself it was nothing, just another bit of University clockwork, but nerves have a way of finding shadows where there are none. As I stepped closer, my skin prickled. My breath felt shallow. The air pressed close against my ribs, thick and strange, though I knew it was only my own fear. I crouched in front of the case, hands careful, heart beating louder than it ought to. The lock met my gaze, all clean lines and simple metal. Practical. Precise. The sort of design that didn’t trust anyone who got too close.

“You’re sure about this?” Sim muttered, a little too loud. His breath brushed against the back of my neck.

“Honest answer?” I said, keeping my hands moving as I spoke. I didn’t look up, and my voice was quieter than I felt. “Not remotely.”

The lock gave way, its well-oiled mechanism yielding without so much as a groan. I lifted the lid. My fingers slipped into the darkness and found the gram waiting there. It was perfect, at first glance. Symmetrical, smooth as riverstone. Polished to a mirror's shine. A thing built to last, to endure. But it was wrong. I felt it, small as a splinter beneath the skin. Subtle, yes. Almost hidden, almost nothing at all. But once I noticed, I couldn’t unfeel it.

I tipped Devi’s vial over the gram. Slow and careful. The liquid was pale gold, thick as honey. It slipped across the sigaldry, winding into every groove. At first, nothing. The air held still. Then light crawled along the lines, thin and sharp. Each edge glittered like frost finding new glass. Bright, cold, undeniable.

Behind me, Sim inhaled. The sound caught. I heard fear coiling in his breath. “Is that normal?”

“No,” I said, though I felt like I was speaking from somewhere else. “It’s not normal. It’s not expected. And it’s definitely not grief.”

I wiped the gram clean. My movements were careful, practiced, leaving nothing behind. Not a smear. Not a whisper. My hands worked faster than my mind, tugging at the edge of the question that pressed close and heavy. Who could have done this? And, worse, who would? The craftsmanship was clever. Elegant. Dangerous.

I tried not to leap to conclusions. Tried not to let suspicion settle. Yet Hemme lingered at the edge of my thoughts. He had the skill. He had the motive. Sometimes, that is enough.

“Done now?” Wil whispered. He watched the hallway, shoulders tight, each breath drawn shallow.

“Yes,” I said, fitting the lock back into place with a final click. My hands felt steady, my voice even, but inside, my blood ran far from calm. As we slipped back into the darkened halls of the Medica, a single thought emerged and settled low in my chest, heavy as an iron weight. This had been deliberate, and it wasn’t over.

### * * *

The night was cold in the courtyard outside, the air crisp and unforgiving. Moonlight spilled unevenly over the cobblestones, pooling in alcoves where ancient gargoyles studied us with chipped and weathered eyes. The chill bit sharper after what we had seen.

“This is where it stops,” Sim said at last. His voice was low, his hands buried deep in his pockets. He leaned against the courtyard wall, close but distant, like he desperately needed something solid. I could hear the weariness in his tone, a line stretched too far and trembling. “We don’t push this. We’ve already gone too far.”

I didn’t respond right away. My fingers toyed with an edge of my cloak, as if they needed to move to keep from curling again into fists. My thoughts twisted, folding and refolding themselves like restless water beneath a frozen bank.

“Hemme won’t admit to anything,” I said finally, each word sharp and distinct, like I’d spent hours shaping them. “Men like him never do. But I don’t need his confession. I just need him to slip.”

“To slip,” Sim repeated, flat and unimpressed. His voice, so often warm, felt far away now. He lifted his head to look at me, his eyes searching for something in my face. “And then what? You want him to tumble down the stairs of your cleverness? When has that ever worked?”

I gave him a faint smile, something quick and dishonest, already moving toward the shadows. “Careful work,” I said. “That’s all it will take. Careful work, and the right ears.”

“That sounds like a terrible plan,” Wil said darkly, crossing his arms as he leaned against the fountain. “Leave Hemme’s name out of it. If you lose control, I don’t even want to imagine the consequences.”

### * * *

Later, Mola would tell me she never looked up. She simply sat at her usual place beneath the cracked stair lamp, pretending to read a Medicae botanica text like she wasn’t listening for footfalls she had no business hearing. Her face calm, back straight, mouth pressed into the kind of line usually reserved for uncooperative patients.

She didn't stop us. That was the important part. A single glance in the wrong direction, one question asked at the wrong time, and the whole thing would have collapsed like bad lungwork.

“I didn’t lie,” she told me, later still. “I just redirected Ezra when he started his rounds early. I told him there was a misfiled note in the apothecary. There wasn’t, but it seemed wiser to avoid letting the archives argue with whatever’s left of a pulse.”

She didn’t say it just to justify herself. Mola never needed my approval, not since the day she saved my life in the Medica. But that night, she chose silence over certainty. That choice required more than courage. It called for quiet belief. She believed in me, in Herma, and in what might still be uncovered.

She didn’t write down what she saw. She didn’t even turn her head. But in that hush between lantern flickers, her presence held steady like the last safe breath before drowning.

The kinds of truths we found that night don’t get admitted to ledgers. But without Mola, we’d never have walked out on our own feet. We might not have walked out at all.

### * * *

The next afternoon, Brandeur’s measured monotone droned in the lecture hall, filling the air like bad music. He tinkered with theories too dry to spark interest, too dull to linger in memory. Most students stared blankly, their minds somewhere else entirely. I sat near the front, making certain my presence unspooled against his awareness like a snagged thread.

“Hemme might’ve thought this was clever,” I muttered, just loud enough to be heard. My lips brushed the words softly, almost to myself, though I chose them with care. “It seems so simple. But it’s always the cracks. Things slip there first.”

To his credit, Brandeur’s voice didn’t stumble midsentence, but the brief flicker of his eyes told me what I needed to know. Some threads, even careless ones, pulled tighter than others.

Hours later, I caught him moving across the cobblestones. His gait was sharp and purposeful, his steps cutting through the twilight gloom. He moved toward Hemme’s office. I trailed him at a distance, my own movements quiet as I made my way to the gargoyle fountain.

The night deepened around me, my breath curling faint in the cold as I crouched low beside the fountain. I reached out with my Alar and coaxed the overcurious wind to weave its thread. One side drifted toward Hemme’s shuttered office while the other slipped toward Kilvin's. Calling the wind was not force. It was seduction, a kind of charm you encouraged gently, as if leading a bird to your open hand. Slowly, I teased softness into firmness and murmured until it yielded.

Hemme’s voice rode the current first, sharp and clipped. “It was delicate work, nothing more. Not sabotage. A gentle nudge. Something no one should have noticed.”

Another voice, softer, less distinct. “And Herma?”

Hemme’s voice carried through the wall. “Herma was old.” There was a thread of exasperation in it, pulled thin. “This didn’t kill him. Time did. I only helped it along.”

The wind trembled. It slipped free of my words, and the voices dissolved into the night. Still, I had heard enough. My teeth clenched against the weight of it. Hemme’s confession was soft. Ordinary. But true. Herma hadn’t needed to die. I could only hope the current I had set loose would carry his words to Kilvin.

### * * *

The trial took weeks to wind its way into motion. Weeks where I made myself stay quiet, an unseen Cthaeh easing pieces into place while others bore the weight of suspicion. Kilvin carried the case where I could not, pulling together threads I’d left carefully loose behind me, his calm authority reshaping what I couldn’t touch directly.

When Hemme finally stood beneath the shadow of the Iron Law, I remained in the gallery, one face in a sea of quiet onlookers. Kilvin testified with grave simplicity, recounting a trail of evidence that pointed unmistakably toward tampering, and toward Hemme. Arwyl followed, dragging the room through his detailed reexamination of Herma’s body. Signs of malfeasance. Tiny, deliberate patterns.

It wasn’t the confession itself that struck Hemme down. It was the weight of too many threads woven against him, and the smallest fray in his infamous control. The records of materials purchased from the Artificery. The faint patterns in Herma’s decline. His accomplice’s silence. It was inevitable, like a rope drawn tight enough to strangle.

But even as the trial resolved, I found no satisfaction. Justice wasn’t sharp, not like guilt. It wasn’t clean. It was heavy and dull, something that settled slowly into grief’s hollow weight. I told myself it was enough, though I could not say for sure if I believed it.

What I know is this. I spent long nights awake, staring at the ceiling, chasing the thought. Wondering if I might have found it sooner. If I had tugged at the thread before it knotted. If it would have made a difference. If it would have mattered.
