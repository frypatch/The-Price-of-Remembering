# CHAPTER 4.

## EARS IN THE WIND.


I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I expected to find in Herma’s guilder. Only that Mola had examined it during the autopsy and set it aside because it didn’t sit right. It had passed their testing and been declared sound, but I needed something they hadn’t tried. Something unorthodox. A moneylender’s livelihood depended on knowing true metal from false. If anyone in Imre had alchemical reagents for testing coins, reagents sensitive enough to reveal what Mola’s conventional testing had missed, it would be Devi.  

Two knocks, and she opened her door.  

“Kvothe. Always a delight,” she said, her smile already half a dare. “Have you come to lose more of your dignity? Or merely to bask in my natural radiance?”  

“Neither,” I said, stepping inside. The windowless rooms pressed close, lit by sympathy lamps that cast familiar shadows across her collection of books. Cinnamon and cardamom laced the air, dulling the butcher shop below to a faint undertone. “Though if you’re offering radiance, I’ll take a double helping.”  

She rolled her eyes but didn’t stop smiling. “Come in then, sweet boy. Sit. What charming trouble have you brought to brighten my doorstep?”  

Over the spiced tea she offered, I explained what I needed. Alchemical reagents that could reveal traces conventional testing might miss. I listed off the metals that composed the grams I’d made, working from my theory that a guilder’s construction couldn’t be so different.  

“Ah,” she said after I finished. “So we’re experimenting, are we? With borrowed alchemy at midnight? How convincingly not suspicious of you.”  

I laughed. “Devi, you’ve always been my preferred source of suspicious materials.”  

She considered the shelf with performative thoughtfulness, then selected several vials. Clear ones. Amber ones. Something dark as old honey. “These should show you what you’re looking for. If there’s anything to find.” She arranged them on the table between us. Five in all. “You’ll owe me. A favor. One of my choosing.”  

I hesitated. “That sounds vague.”  

“Vagueness, dear Kvothe, is the spice of life. You’ll say yes, of course.”  

“And if I don’t?”  

“Then I’ll never make you tea again,” she said brightly. “And you’ll be forced to rot in ignorance, alone and unloved.”  

I kept my smile in place, though my gut twisted at the idea of owing her anything undefined. Still, something in the set of her eyes made it feel less than a trap. She wasn’t hunting me. Not today. So I took the vial, bowing slightly. “You are insufferable.”  

“Oh, darling.” Her smile widened. “But you suffer so beautifully.”  

### * * *  

That night at the Medica’s side entrance, with the vials sitting cold against my hip, I met Wil and Sim. Once inside, sympathy lamps glowed softly, casting long shadows across polished surfaces. All around us, the silence pressed in.  

“This is ridiculous,” Wil muttered, shoulders tight, as if the Medica’s clinical smell made his skin crawl. “Weeks of good decisions. Gone with one bad idea and more bad wine.”  

“Two skins of wine,” Sim corrected. He kept his arms tight against his sides, as if trying to contain a panic that threatened to spill over. “And when Arwyl skins us alive, don’t expect me to defend either of you.”  

“No one’s catching us,” I murmured, feigning confidence. Ahead of us, nestled against the wall, sat Herma’s guilder among the other examined effects from the autopsy. The case was plain glass and brass, easy to overlook. Motioning for Wil to stand watch, I stepped forward to crouch in front of the case. My fingers fidgeted restlessly as I examined the lock. All clean lines and precise metalwork. Simple. Practical. The sort of design that promised to be more difficult than it looked.  

“You’re sure about this?” Sim said in a voice that was as close to a shout as a whisper could be.  

“Truthfully?” I said, working the lock as I spoke. I didn’t look up, and my voice was quieter than I felt. “Not remotely.”  

But I’d opened worse. My fingers found the pins, and the lock gave way, its well-oiled mechanism yielding without so much as a click. I lifted the lid. The guilder looked ordinary at first glance. A flat lead disc with sygaldry stamped into its surface. Plain. Utilitarian. The sort of token any full arcanist carried. When I picked it up, the numbing sensation was there, like it had been when I’d held Abenthy’s guilder. But its protective bite was blunted, and didn’t grow as I held it longer. Underneath, my fingers detected what felt like a crackled surface, but when I turned it over the back was smooth and unremarkable.  

I tipped Devi’s vial over the guilder. Slow and careful. At first, nothing as the liquid slipped across the sygaldry. Then, salt crystals crawled along lines, thin and sharp, glittering like frost.  

Behind me, Sim inhaled. His breath caught. “Is that normal?”  

“No,” I said, wiping the guilder clean with a jeweler’s cloth from my pocket. “Devi’s reagent tests for metallic corruption. Foreign elements that shouldn’t be there.” I held the guilder to the light. “A proper guilder would show clear channels, maybe a faint residue from use. Not this. These crystals mean something was introduced to the sygaldry.”  

“Done?” Wil whispered. He watched the hallway, shoulders tight, each breath drawn shallow.  

“Yes,” I said, fitting the lock back into place with a final click. My hands worked faster than my mind, the question weighing on me. Who could have done this? And, worse, who would? The sabotage was clever. Elegant, even. I tried not to leap to conclusions. Tried not to let suspicion settle. But this had been deliberate, and it wasn’t over.  

### * * *  

Later, Mola would tell me she never looked up. She simply sat at her usual place beneath the cracked stair lamp, pretending to read a Medicae botanica text like she wasn’t listening for footfalls she had no business hearing. That she had kept a calm face and just pressed her lips into the kind of line usually reserved for uncooperative patients.  

“I didn’t lie,” she had told me. “I just redirected Ezra when he started his rounds early. I told him there was a misfiled note in the apothecary. There wasn’t, but it seemed wiser to put him somewhere else.”  

She didn’t say it just to justify herself. Mola never needed my approval, not since the day she saved my life in the Medica. But that night, she chose silence over certainty. That choice required more than courage. It called for belief in me.  

### * * *  

The night was cold in the courtyard, the air crisp and unforgiving. Moonlight spilled unevenly over the cobblestones. The chill bit sharper after what we had seen.  

Wil leaned against the courtyard wall. “This stops here.”  

I didn’t respond right away. My fingers toyed with an edge of my cloak. I couldn’t settle my thoughts.  

“Kvothe, we’ve already gone too far,” Sim said, his hands buried deep in his pockets, his voice tight with worry. “Yes, something is definitely wrong. Something very wrong. But we need to bring this to the Masters. We have to.”  

“Hemme won’t admit to anything,” I said, the pieces fitting too well to ignore. “Men like him never do. But I don’t need his confession. I just need him to slip.”  

Sim glanced nervously at Wil. “We don’t even know it’s Hemme.”  

Wil nodded. “And what if it is? You trap him with clever words?”  

I gave him a staged smile. “Please, let me try. Give me three days of careful work. That’s all it will take. Careful work, and the right ears.”  

“Careful work?” Sim’s voice rose slightly. “Kvothe, this is dangerous.”  

“Three days,” Wil said, cutting through the protest, his gaze holding steady on me. “But after that, I’m done.”  

### * * *

The afternoon found me in a forgotten corner of the Fishery, gathering materials so simple they drew no attention. Thin copper wire, two small brass resonators no larger than thimbles, and a cake of rosin.  

Chronicler’s pen stopped mid-stroke. He looked up sharply. “Wait. Is this when you invented the far listener?”  

Kote blinked at the interruption, pulled from the memory. “What? No.” He laughed, reaching for his mug. “Chronicler, every child knows about creating toys fashioned from connecting two cups with a string. I simply tried better materials.”  

“But,” Chronicler began, setting down his pen carefully. “The far listener. The ones the Commonwealth uses to coordinate their road stations and post houses. You’re saying that came from a child’s toy?”  

“Isn’t that where most good ideas come from?” Kote shrugged. “I needed to hear a conversation through fifty feet of stone wall. I was about to try anything, even a child’s toy.”  

“But how does it work?” Chronicler leaned forward. “How does sound travel through a wire?”  

“I don’t know,” Kote admitted.  

Chronicler blinked. “You don’t know?”  

“I know that it works,” Kote said. “I know that metal wire works better than string. That taut works better than loose. That bell-shapes catch sound better than flat disks. That copper is better than iron.” I ticked off points on my fingers. “I know that if you add a binding rune, it carries farther. If you add a clarity rune, it comes through cleaner. But how the sound moves through metal?” He shook my head. “No idea. It just does.”  

“So you just tried things until they worked?”  

“Isn’t that what all artificers do?” Kote smiled. “Master Kilvin himself once told me, ‘The world does not care what you think should work. It only cares what does.’ So I tried everything I could think of. Kept what worked, discarded what didn’t.”  

Bast grinned. “Forty-seven failures.”  

“Forty-seven attempts,” Kote corrected. “Each one taught me something.” He paused. “Though I’ll admit, most of what they taught me was ‘don’t do that again.’”  

“Still,” Chronicler said slowly, “to improve a child’s toy into something the Commonwealth relies on?”  

“I worked on it afterwards,” Kote admitted. “Refined the design. It became something of a project. Took most of a span and those forty-seven attempts to really perfect it. But I learned what mattered. Wire thickness, resonator shape, rune placement, proper mounting to maintain tension.” Warmth crept into his face. “With the right setup, multiple relay stations carefully calibrated, I was able to maintain perfect clarity at over three miles. Under ideal conditions.”  

Chronicler stared at him. “Three miles.”  

“It’s what finally convinced Kilvin to sponsor me for El’the,” Kote confessed. “I showed him how it could coordinate emergency response across the University. He saw the potential for road safety, coordinating healers between towns,” He paused. “Though I’ve heard rumors the Commonwealth military adopted them later. Kilvin wouldn’t have been pleased about that.” He looked down at his mug. “But that first night, I only needed it to work fifty feet. And I needed it to work the first time.”  

“And did it?” Chronicler asked.  

“Well enough,” Kote said. “I’d recruited Sim the previous evening for testing in my room at Anker’s. Thread versus string versus wire. Paper cups versus tin versus brass. Loose versus taut. Every combination I could manage in an hour, speaking softly into one end while Sim listened on the other side of my closed door, trying to hear over the common room's noise. But truly, the difficult part wasn’t the device itself.”  

### * * *  

The Masters’ lounge sat on the second floor of Hollows, overlooking the inner courtyard. I’d been inside exactly once, delivering a message for Master Lorren. Large leather chairs. Dark wood paneling. A fireplace for the colder months. And most importantly, Masters gathered there after dinner, discussing University business over wine and conversation.  

Getting inside during the afternoon was simple enough. A word with the right servant, a claim about checking the sympathy lamp over the reading desk. The lounge was usually empty this time of day. Masters were teaching, or in their offices, or in the Archives.  

I worked quickly. The wire fed up from Hemme’s office on the third floor of the Rhetoric wing, through the same maintenance shaft that carried sympathy lamp lines to the roof. From there, I’d threaded it across the ridgeline and fished it down through the chimney shaft. It had taken me an hour the night before, testing routes by tapping on stone and listening for hollow spaces. Now the wire emerged behind the fireplace in the Masters’ lounge, exactly where I needed it.  

I secured the horn-shaped resonator there, wedged it carefully so it wouldn’t shift and hid it from view. Positioned it to project toward the center of the room where conversation would naturally gather. Then I tested the tension. Plucked the wire gently and listened. It sang with a clear tone. Good. That meant whatever Hemme said in his office should be heard here.  

I told myself it might not work. The wire could snap from tension before evening came. The resonance might be too weak to project clearly into the room. Hemme might not have the conversation I needed, or might have it somewhere else entirely. The Masters might not gather in the lounge tonight. Or the wrong Masters might be there.  

But I only had three days to trap him.  

And this was already day two.  

### * * *  

The next afternoon, Brandeur droned on in the lecture hall, something about geometric proofs and their elegant certainties. Most students stared blankly, their minds wandering.  

I had dragged Sim along, and we sat near the front. Close enough to be seen. Close enough to be heard.  

When the lecture ended and students shuffled toward the doors, we lingered. Brandeur’s portly frame moved methodically as he packed his materials. Sim shot me a questioning look, but I kept my attention on my notes, making a show of reviewing them.  

I waited until the room had nearly emptied. Then, pitching my voice the way my father had taught me, a stage whisper that would carry to where Brandeur stood while seeming intimate, I said to Sim, “Hemme must have thought himself clever. Such delicate work.” I paused, as if considering. “But even the smallest flaws have a way of revealing themselves.”  

To his credit, Brandeur’s hands didn’t pause with their packing, but the brief flicker of his eyes toward us told me what I needed to know.  

The seed was planted.  

### * * *  

Dinner bells had rung. Classes dismissed. The afternoon dissolved into evening.  

I’d been lounging on a doorway stoop. Waiting. Watching. When Brandeur finally emerged from the Masters' quarters, he headed straight towards the Rhetoric wing. Towards Hemme’s office. His gait was sharp. Purposeful. His usual cautious shuffle replaced by something more urgent.  

Dinner must have ended. The other masters would be gathering in the lounge for their evening discussions. If they followed their usual routine. If enough of the right Masters were there. If the device I’d planted actually worked.  

Too many ifs.  

But it was too late to change anything now. I’d set everything in motion.   

The device was planted. Brandeur would confront Hemme after dinner, when Masters typically gathered in the lounge.  

Or he wouldn’t.  

Or he would, but the lounge would be empty.  

Or Hemme would notice the brass resonator hidden behind the chair.  

Or the wire had snapped during the day.  

Or only Hemme’s allies would be there to hear it, and I’d be expelled by morning.  

Or. Or. Or.  

I paced. The not knowing was worse than anything. I’d gambled everything on a plan where I couldn’t even know if it had worked. No way to hear if Masters were in the lounge. No way to know if the device projected clearly enough. No way to know if Hemme had even said anything worth hearing.  

The anxiety built. Coiled tight in my chest from the desperate need to know. To hear what was happening in that room. To find out if everything I’d risked had been for nothing.  

I needed to know. Needed to hear.  

The wind came then.  

Not called. Not commanded. Just. There. The way it had been lately when my emotions ran too hot, too desperate. When grief or rage or need became so sharp that the sleeping mind woke and reached for the Name before the waking mind even knew what it was doing.  

I stopped pacing. Let the anxiety wash over me instead of fighting it. Let myself be still in the center of that desperate need. Reached for that quiet place where Names could be perceived. Where understanding lived beneath conscious thought.  

The wind wasn't separate from me anymore. It was around me, through me, part of my awareness. I could feel it moving through the courtyard, between buildings, through gaps and cracks. And in that deep understanding of what wind was, I felt trembles, pulses. The air remembering what had moved through it.  

Voices?  

Thin. Distant. Fragmented. Like listening to a conversation three stalls away in the crowded streets of Tarbean. But my ears were ready.  

“...impossible. Herma’s gram was inspected...” Kilvin’s voice, sharp with disbelief.  

Then others, overlapping. Arwyl saying something about the autopsy. Dal’s measured tones cutting through. Elodin’s voice, saying something I couldn’t quite catch but edged with anger.  

And underneath it all, the device projected Hemme’s voice. “...nough of this. I told you already, you're over thinkin...” “...quiet no one will...” “...grace to retire.”  

The wind trembled. My focus wavered, and the voices began to dissolve. I didn’t try to hold them. Didn’t need to.  

I let the wind go. Let the voices fade.  

### * * *  

Classes were delayed again as the trial took weeks to wind its way into motion. Weeks where I made myself stay quiet, an unseen Cthaeh easing pieces into place while others bore the weight of suspicion. Kilvin carried the case where I could not, pulling together threads I’d left carefully loose behind me, his calm authority reshaping what I couldn’t touch directly.  

When Hemme finally stood beneath the shadow of the Iron Law, I remained in the gallery, one face in a sea of quiet onlookers. Kilvin testified with grave simplicity, recounting a trail of evidence that pointed unmistakably toward tampering, and toward Hemme. Arwyl followed, dragging the room through his detailed reexamination of Herma’s body. Signs of malfeasance. Tiny, deliberate patterns.  

It wasn’t the confession itself that struck Hemme down. It was the weight of too many threads woven against him, and the smallest fray in his infamous control. The records of materials purchased from the Artificery. The faint patterns in Herma’s decline. His accomplice’s silence. It was inevitable, like a rope drawn tight enough to strangle.  

But even as the trial resolved, I found no satisfaction. Justice wasn’t sharp, not like guilt. It wasn’t clean. It was heavy and dull, something that settled slowly into grief’s hollow weight. I told myself it was enough, though I could not say for sure if I believed it.  

What I know is this. I spent long nights awake, staring at the ceiling, chasing the thought. Wondering if I might have found it sooner. If I had tugged at the thread before it knotted. If it would have made a difference. If it would have mattered.
