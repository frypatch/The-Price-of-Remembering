# CHAPTER 37.

## THE BREATH AFTER THE FALL.


I FELL.  

The world came undone in that breathless moment. Wind sang its terrible song against my ears while the white walls of the Citadel blurred to nothing more than a chalk smear above me. The tower’s wound gaped down like the hollow socket of a dead god’s eye. But I was already beyond it. Beyond the courtyard where Fascino’s men might have caught me. I was falling instead down the sheer face where the outer wall met only air and appetite. Below waited not the cobblestones of the courtyard but the city with its distant rooftop bones.  

Wind tore at me then. It pulled at my clothes with angry fingers and tangled itself in my hair like a scorned lover. My ribs sang their own broken song with each breath I stole from the rushing air. Pain had a voice and it was screaming.  

But something deeper than panic stirred in me. Something older than fear. My fingers found only emptiness when they reached for purchase, grasping at air the way drowning men grasp at water. Through the red haze of pain and the white blindness of terror, I felt it waiting. The Name of the Wind hung there at the edge of my knowing, patient as starlight.  

I spoke it. Not gently. Not kindly. I wrenched the word from some deep place where desperate things are born.  

The wind heard me. And it sighed.  

I had called it too often today. Named it like a master who forgets his servant needs rest. Named it until my voice had worn grooves in its nature. The wind knew me now the way a horse knows a cruel rider, and it came to my call with all the enthusiasm of a beaten dog returning to its master’s hand.  

It obeyed. That was the binding. That was the law written into its true name. But obedience and service are different creatures entirely. The wind caught me in fits and starts, doing precisely what was commanded and not one breath more. It held me the way you might hold something distasteful. Barely. Reluctantly. With the absolute minimum of care required by the compact between us.  

Air pushed and pulled like a sullen child forced to help with chores. My descent slowed, yes. But the ground still rose to meet me with all the tenderness of an anvil meeting steel.  

The impact broke across me like thunder breaking sky. Pain bloomed through every bone I owned and several I had only borrowed. I lay there in the wet grass, crumpled like a letter someone had read and thrown away. Each breath a shard of glass finding its way through my chest. Above me, faces appeared at the Citadel’s broken edge. Pale as winter moons. Their shouts reached me the way sound reaches you underwater, distant and strange and somehow less than real. The earth beneath me felt too solid and I too broken to bear its weight. The darkness that came for me was patient and certain as stone.  

### * * *

I woke the way men wake from drowning. Gasping. Burning. My lungs remembered what air was and demanded more of it than the world seemed willing to give.  

A shape moved above me. Pale skin and ink-dark hair resolved themselves into something familiar. Into someone familiar.  

“Reshi, lie still.” Bast’s voice held an edge I rarely heard from him. Sharp words with something soft and frightened underneath. “You’re broken in more ways than I can count and several I haven’t thought to look for yet. Let me hold you together before you finish what the fall started.”  

His hands on my shoulders were light as leaves. Careful. As if I were made of ash and might scatter at the slightest wind. I tried to speak his name but my throat gave me only the sound a door makes when its hinges have gone to rust.  

“You’re alive,” he said. The words seemed more prayer than observation.  

Footsteps approached through the grass. Bast’s eyes went from gold to green the way forest light changes when storm clouds gather. “Well, if it isn’t the queen of impeccable timing,” he said dryly.  

Denna knelt beside me and her movements were quick water over stone. Her cloak came free with practiced ease and she folded it into something soft for my head. “I came because someone needs saving. You’re welcome to keep growling at shadows while time bleeds away if that suits you better.”  

Bast muttered something that might have been a curse or might have been a prayer. The difference between the two had always been a matter of perspective.  

Denna turned to me then and her face held too many things at once. Worry and tenderness and something harder underneath. She brushed hair from my forehead with fingers that knew how to be gentle with broken things. “Kvothe. Can you stand?”  

The question might as well have asked if I could fly. If I could turn lead to gold. If I could speak the moon down from the sky. My answer was a groan that barely qualified as human.  

She didn’t wait for better words. My arm went over her shoulder and she tried to lift. Her strength surprised what little part of me could still feel surprise. But even she couldn’t manage alone.  

“Help me.” Two words aimed at Bast like arrows.  

He showed his teeth in something that wasn’t quite anger and wasn’t quite a smile. “If I break what’s left of him, remember whose idea this was.”  

“I’ve carried heavier burdens than blame.”  

They moved me with all the grace of people trying to fold a map in a windstorm. Careful and clumsy in equal measure. Together they managed to drape me over the waiting horse like a sack of grain that had learned to feel pain. I held the reins the way you hold onto thoughts in a fever. Something warm and wet painted itself across my fingers but I couldn’t spare the effort to care.  

Between them passed glances sharp as knives and silent as snowfall. Some wordless negotiation played out in the space between their eyes. But I couldn’t hold onto the shape of it. The darkness rose again like water from a well, and I let it take me.  

### * * *

Hours dissolved into indistinct flashes of sensation. The horse beneath me beat out a rhythm that might have been minutes or might have been days. Every small motion sent fresh letters of pain through my ribs, written in a script I couldn’t help but read. Their voices reached me in fragments. Bast’s curses sharp as winter. Denna’s responses soft as snow.  

“How much farther?” Bast snapped, though it sounded more like desperation than impatience.  

“Far enough to matter,” Denna replied. “Not far enough for you to complain about it.”  

When I stirred to consciousness on a particularly rough stretch of road, her voice found me first. She was humming something that might have been a lullaby or might have been a dirge. In Modegan, the two are often the same song sung in different keys. Before I could catch the melody, before I could hold it like water in my hands, the darkness pulled me under again.  

### * * *

I woke to rough wood beneath my palms and the sound of stone teaching echoes how to dance. The room held me in dim light the way cupped hands hold water. Carefully. Temporarily. Most of me didn’t care where I was, only that the world had stopped trying to kill me for the moment.  

Denna’s voice pulled me back from the edge of nothing. Low. Urgent. Close enough that I could feel the words as much as hear them. “Bast, steady his legs.”  

“Might as well steady smoke,” Bast muttered, but his hands were there when she needed them.  

Together they moved me to something that might have been a bed or might have been clouds. I couldn’t tell and didn’t care. Cloth pressed against my chest. Hands packed something that burned and soothed in equal measure. Then came bitter liquid, thick as regret, forced between my lips.  

“Drink,” Denna commanded. “And don’t argue.”  

Another swallow, and whatever strength I’d been hoarding fled like birds before storm. But beneath the exhaustion, beneath the pain that had become my closest companion, a single thought bloomed. For Auri. For Sim. For Wil. My hands moved weakly, catching at air, holding nothing but holding it fiercely.  

### * * *

The ceiling above me was walnut wood striped with shadows from the shuttered window, and I studied it the way scholars study dead languages. Slowly. Without much hope of understanding. Light crept through curtains like a thief testing locks, and I knew this place wasn’t the University. Too clean. Too quiet. Too empty of the thousand small sounds that learning makes.  

“Denna?” The word barely escaped my throat.  

No answer came. Just the patient silence of a room that had been waiting for me to wake.  

I forced myself upright, though my body filed several formal complaints about the process. Pain bloomed through me in a garden of varieties.  

The rest of me was painted in bruises like an artist’s study in purple and gold and green. There, the sharp ache where the crossbow bolt had bitten deep, Auri’s careful stitches holding despite the Tower’s chaos, each one precise as her gentle hands could make them. Here, the deeper throb where Dagon’s blade had found its home, the stitching crude as truth but holding. Amateur work by someone who cared more for my living than for leaving pretty scars. Each bruise a memory of falling. Each wound a reminder that I had survived it.  

My clothes waited on a chair like patient servants. Caesura lay on the table, faithful as a hound. My shaed hung there, darkness waiting to wrap itself around me again. Dressing took forever and hurt for most of it, but when I finally pulled the shaed over my shoulders, something in me remembered what it was to be whole. Or at least to pretend at wholeness convincingly.  

In my pocket, my fingers found unexpected weight. I drew out the compass Wil had made for us in the Tower. The needle trembled like a living thing, pointing toward something I couldn’t see but desperately needed to find. “If Denna still has hers,” I whispered to the empty room, and the thought burned brighter than the pain.  

### * * *

I stepped into the street, hood drawn low against the light and recognition both. Every step cost me, but I had currency to spare. The sign above the door creaked in the wind, and when I turned to look, I saw it for the first time. A willow tree wound around a blooming rose, painted with the careful hand of someone who understood that beauty and thorns often grow from the same stem.  

> The Willow Blossom.  

Denna’s sanctuary. Of course she would bring me here, to this place that stood between worlds. The Citadel’s men would never think to look for me in such an unassuming place. They’d expect grander hiding.  

For the first time since the Tower had fallen around me like a house of cards in a hurricane, something in my chest unclenched. Not hope exactly, but hope’s younger sister. The one that whispers maybe when the world insists on never.  

I was alive. That had to count for something. That had to be the beginning of something.  

Somewhere, Auri waited. Somewhere, the compass needle pointed toward answers or at least toward better questions. Somewhere, in all this darkness, there had to be a door that opened onto light.  

I pulled the shaed tighter around me and began to walk.
