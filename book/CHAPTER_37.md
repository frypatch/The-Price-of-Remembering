# CHAPTER 37.

## THE BREATH AFTER THE FALL.


I FELL, AND the world unraveled in the breathless rush of wind against my ears. The white walls of the Citadel blurred into a chalk line above me, and the jagged hole from the mangonel stared down like an empty, unblinking eye. For a moment, the city’s distant rooftops and cobblestone streets painted themselves as a cruel certainty—hard, cold, and absolute.  

The wind tore at my clothes and whipped through my hair. My ribs screamed with every movement, each breath a jagged edge. Still, something clawed at my mind—not just panic or instinct, but a part of me that would not surrender. My fingers curled against empty air, reaching like a drowning man toward a memory of strength. Then, past the haze of pain and fear, the light waiting at the edges of my unraveling: the Name of the Wind.  

I called it with desperation, wrenching the word from somewhere deep enough to feel primal and raw. The wind hesitated for the briefest moment. Then it obeyed—not gently or kindly, but with brutal, jarring force. The air caught my body in uneven fits, pushing and pulling me like a cruel child toying with a doll. My descent slowed, but the impact still came as an unforgiving shock.  

When I finally struck the ground, pain exploded across me like lightning splintering every bone. I lay in the damp grass, my breaths broken and shallow. Faces flickered above me in the distance, pale and stunned as they leaned over the Citadel’s jagged wall. Shouts blurred into the background, faint and distant. But my body stayed fixed in its small crater of bruised earth, too broken to heed them. Darkness poured over me, heavy and certain.  

### * * *

I surfaced with a gasp, lungs burning as though I had been held underwater. At first, I saw only the blurry outline of a figure above me—skin pale, hair dark as spilled ink—but the voice that followed was familiar.  

“Reshi, lie still.” Bast's tone held urgency rarely reserved for me, his words sharp but trembling underneath. “You’re broken in every possible way. I’ll hold you together, but you have to *stop moving* before you finish what the fall couldn’t.”  

His hands gripped my shoulders lightly, holding me like I might crumble entirely under the weight of his touch. I managed to croak his name, the raw scrape of it across my throat sounding less like a word and more like a dying man’s groan.  

“You’re alive,” he murmured, almost like the words were meant more for himself.  

Then his head snapped toward the sound of approaching footsteps. As the crunch of grass grew louder, Bast’s gold-green eyes darkened. “Well, if it isn’t the queen of impeccable timing,” he said dryly.  

“Clever as ever, Bast,” came Denna's voice. She stepped into view, her frame cutting against the gray sky above, her hair wild and windswept. As always, she willed herself calm, though her sharp glance at my condition betrayed her worry.  

“Are you here to slow us down with more riddles and tricks?” Bast growled.  

Denna knelt shielded from his scorn, her hands quick and purposeful as they unpinned her cloak. She rolled it into something soft and set it gently beneath my head. “I’m here because someone needs to save him. And you’re wasting air bickering when seconds matter.”  

She ignored Bast as he muttered under his breath, turning her full attention to me. “Kvothe,” she murmured, brushing hair from my face, her expression equal parts tender and grim. “We don’t have time. Can you stand?”  

The question clawed weakly at my fading awareness. No more than a groan spilled from my lips. Not waiting for an answer, Denna tucked one of my arms over her shoulder and tried lifting, gritting her teeth at the weight. Her strength surprised me, if only dimly, though it was clear even she couldn’t manage it alone.  

She turned to Bast, her voice tight but practical. “Help me.”  

He bared his teeth in raw frustration—not quite a smile, not quite anger—before slipping his hands beneath my shoulders. “If I snap whatever pieces are holding him together, that’s your fault,” he said.  

“I’m used to working against impossible odds,” she replied evenly.  

Their movements were clumsy but coordinated, both of them leveraging care against urgency. Together, they half-dragged, half-draped me over the horse waiting nearby. I groaned as they jostled me over the saddle, the pain driving a new wave of black into the edges of my vision. I clung to the leather reins as though they might anchor me, ignoring the warm stickiness under my fingers.  

Little flickers of contact between Bast and Denna passed unnoticed by neither of them nor myself: fleeting glances, sharp and wordless, as though a negotiation played out silently in their minds. But I couldn’t hold the sight of them. The ache surged again, and the dark claimed me once more.  

### * * *

Hours dissolved into indistinct flashes of sensation. The rhythm of the horse’s steps blurred into a lulling monotony of sound while every slight jolt screamed betrayal through my ribs. Faint snatches of their voices reached me: Bast’s sharp-edged curses, Denna’s quieter, tighter handling of answers. One moment bled into the next without clarity of focus.  

“How much farther?” Bast snapped, though it sounded more like desperation than impatience.  

Denna’s reply barely broke the space between them. “Far enough to matter. And not nearly far enough for you to start complaining.”  

When I stirred briefly to the sound of cracks in a dirt path beneath hooves, her voice softened into fragments of a hum—a lullaby perhaps, or something faintly Modegan. Before the scattered tune could coalesce, I fell back into the drift of pain.  

### * * *

I awoke to rough wood beneath my hands and sharp edges of sound—stone floors, footsteps, faint shuffles of movement. The room embraced me with dim light, its edges indistinct but safe. Most of me didn’t care where I was, so long as there was no shouting, no death.  

Denna’s voice pulled me back from the haze, low and urgent as she crouched beside me: “Bast, steady his legs.”  

“Might as well ask me to steady a falling building,” Bast muttered, though he followed her instruction without protest. Together, they eased me into what felt like a bed.  

Somewhere in the thick fog of my mind, I felt cloth against my chest and hands packing something there. Pressure bloomed briefly, sharp and insistent, before fading into muted relief. Then came the taste of bitterness—a slick liquid forced between my lips, stinging as it tangled with the back of my throat.  

“Drink,” Denna commanded softly. “And don’t argue.”  

Another swallow, and whatever strength I had left was pulled from me. Still, beyond the ache, a single thought broke through: for Auri. For Sim. For Wil. My hands flexed weakly, clutching at nothing as I gave myself back to exhaustion.  

### * * *

The ceiling above me was unfamiliar, walnut paneling latticed in shadow by pale light seeping through curtains. At first, I thought I’d been taken back to the Blind Beggar, but no—it was too clean, too orderly. No sour reek of old ale or damp wood clung to the air.  

“Denna?” I croaked, my voice thin and brittle, but no answer came. I lay there for a while longer, letting my limbs catch up with my thoughts.  

Eventually, I forced myself upright, swinging my legs over the edge of the bed. Agony flared through me, though it was dull and deep now, no longer the sharp fire of fresh wounds. My fingers instinctively went to the worst of it—the place where Dagon’s blade had pierced my chest. Bandaging and dark stitches crisscrossed the bruised skin like crude repairs on a shattered lute. Poorly done, but functional.  

My shoulder, where the crossbow bolt had struck earlier, bore similar handiwork. “Amateur,” I muttered, while some distant, softer part of me allowed I might have been dead without it. Denna’s work, no doubt.  

As I examined the rest of my affronted body, mottled with bruises in purples, yellows, and faint greens, memories of the Tower crept into my mind unbidden. Sim. Wil. My breath hitched sharply. My weakened legs threatened to give out, but I braced myself against a table, unwilling to crumble just yet.  

I spied my torn clothes draped over a nearby chair, and Caesura lying on a table opposite. My shaed hung there, untouched and waiting like a second skin. Dressing was a slow process, each motion a deliberate test of will. Sliding my shirt over my head pulled at the stitches in uncomfortable ways; pulling on my trousers was no less forgiving. But when I threw the shaed over my shoulders, a strange, fragile relief washed over me, as though I’d reclaimed something vital.  

It was then I found it—a pressure in my pocket. I reached inside, withdrawing the compass Wil had made for us in the Tower. I turned it over slowly in my hands, remembering its purpose: to find each other when all seemed lost. "If Denna still has hers..." The idea formed weakly in my thoughts but burned brighter with every passing second. This was something. A thread.  

### * * *

I stepped gingerly into the street, the hood of my shaed pulled low. The aches in my body surged with every step, but I pressed onward. The sign above creaked faintly in the wind, and it wasn’t until I turned to look at it—the painted image of a willow intertwined with a blossoming rose—that I realized I knew the name: *The Willow Blossom.*  

Denna’s sanctuary. Clever of her to bring me here. The White Citadel and Alveron’s men wouldn’t think to look for me in such an unassuming place.  

For the first time since the Tower, a flicker of resolve sparked within me. I was alive, and I intended to make that matter. There was still so much to do, so much to reckon with. For now, I clung to hope: that Denna was still out there, that Auri had survived, that somewhere in all of this, I would find a way forward.
