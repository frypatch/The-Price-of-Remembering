# CHAPTER 7.

## A SONG WITHOUT WORDS.


WHEN I CAME DOWN from the mountains, I went looking for my friends. I had apologies to make. Taking off like that, leaving nothing but a note at Anker’s, wasn’t the sort of thing you did to people who mattered.  

I found Simmon first. He was in the courtyard near the fountain. When he spotted me, he was on his feet in an instant, his face cycling through relief, excitement, and something harder to name.  

“You’re back.” He clasped my arm. “Where did you go? No, never mind. How much do you know?”  

“I know admissions started,” I said. “Beyond that, nothing.”  

Sim nodded. “Well, Kilvin is Chancellor. Manet is Master Rhetorician.”  

I stopped walking. “Manet?”  

“Yup.” Sim’s mouth quirked. “He refused three times. Said he had no interest in politics and less in teaching fools to argue. But Kilvin insisted. Said the University needed ‘a mentor in that chair.’”  

I tried to picture it. Manet sitting behind the long table. Manet, the eternal E’lir, who had been a student longer than most Masters had held their chairs. Who played corners for ha’pennies and gave advice like other men gave weather reports. Now he would sit across from me and set my tuition.  

“And Brandeur?” I asked.  

Sim’s smile faded. “Still here. Still Master Arithmetician. They couldn’t prove anything under the iron law. But everyone knows. The other Masters won’t speak to him. He sits alone. Takes his meals alone. Honestly, I think expulsion would have been kinder.”  

Sim reached into his pocket and pressed a clay chit into my hand. “Tomorrow. Second bell.”  

I looked at it, then back at him. “Sim, I can’t take your slot.”  

“It’s not mine.” His ears went red. “I drew for both of us.”  

“How?”  

Sim shifted his weight. “I may have reminded someone that my father is the Duke of Dalonir. And that the Duke’s fourth son was requesting a small courtesy for a friend.”  

In all the time I’d known him, I had never once heard Sim leverage his family’s name.  

“Sim.”  

“Don’t.” His ears were still red. “It’s fine. Can we talk about something else?”  

I pocketed the chit.  

Classes would be back in session. Life at the University had, at last, continued on.  

### * * *

Elodin’s Naming class crackled with restless energy. Firelight from the torches danced across the stone walls, throwing shadows that writhed like living things.

“Kvothe.” Elodin’s voice cut through the air, snapping my name like a bowstring. “To the center.”

I hesitated, but only for a heartbeat. Every eye in the room traced my movements as I stepped forward. I stood in the circle of space Elodin had carved out for moments like this, beneath the heavy gaze of ancient stonework and brighter, watchful eyes.

Elodin paced slow circles around me, his movement oddly graceful, like a bird inspecting its prey after deciding it wasn’t, in fact, dead. “Tell me,” he said quietly. “What do you see in a Name?”

His tone was too calm, too deliberate, and I braced myself. “I see truth,” I replied, my voice measured, even.

Elodin stopped pacing. The faintest smile curved along his lips. “Clever. And true enough. But truth is not simple. It is not clean.” He began to move again, circling me steadily. “Truth is layered, Kvothe. A fragile thread wrapped in lies, in doubt, in sharp things eager to snap under tension.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but Elodin wasn’t waiting.

“A Name,” he said, “is more than truth. It is balance. It is connection. It is weight. It is the thing beneath all things.”

He paused then, looking straight at me, eyes bright and sharp. “If you pull too hard on one thread,” he said. He gestured, and a breath of wind moved through the room. It came light as a whisper, brushing against my cheek.

“Everything comes undone.”

The air thickened. I could feel it winding tighter around me, impossibly heavy.

Elodin leaned closer, his voice soft as silk. “Say it.”

The Name hovered on the edge of sense, spinning just beyond my reach. And then, like plucking a string I couldn’t see, it rang through me. Not as sound exactly, but as a trembling resonance that pulled through my chest and fingers. The wind moved, shifting in perfect harmony with the name I didn’t so much call as breathe. A melody hidden within silence, waiting to be played.

For a moment, it lingered at my side, light as breath, alive with motion. Then, thin as glass, it formed a ring around my finger before dissolving.

The room fell still. Papers that had scattered in the sudden wind settled softly to the ground. No one spoke.

“Beautifully done,” he said, his tone a strange mix of reverence and regret. He stepped closer, tilting his head like a bird both curious and wary. “A ring of air. A rare thing. The first step toward something.” He hesitated, studying the space where the wind had been, then nodded faintly. “A pity. So lovely. So doomed.”

I barely heard him. I was still caught in the moment before, held captive by the raw and fragile truth of what I’d just touched. It wasn’t just a moment or a trick. It was proof that I had crossed some invisible line.  

### * * *

Auri’s rooftop was where it always was, quietly hidden, holding its breath just for me. When I climbed the last set of stones, I found her perched on the edge, her legs swinging over a gap as carelessly as a child dangling them in water. She turned at the sound of my boots, and her face broke into a wide smile, as though the sky itself had gifted her the sight of me.  

“Welcome home, Kvothe,” she said, prim and polished, as though I had kept her waiting for precisely this moment.  

I returned her smile, setting my pack down with a low thump. “You always know,” I said.  

“Of course I do,” she replied, tilting her head with a smug twist to her lips. “The wind told me. Did you catch it?”  

I laughed, shaking my head. “Catch it? That’s the wrong question altogether.”  

Auri raised a finger, as if to challenge me. “But did you ride it?”  

“No.” I sighed, dropping to sit beside her. The stone was cool beneath me, a quiet contrast to the warmth her presence brought. “But I got closer.”  

“That’s good enough,” she said lightly. “You’ll be Taborlin the Great before you know it.”  

Her eyes drifted to the bulging sack at my side, and she gasped. “Oh! What did you find this time?”  

“A few things,” I said, reaching into my pack. “And this.” I pulled free a bundle of rich blue fabric, folded neatly and tied with a thin strip of leather. “A gift for you.”  

Her hands flew to her cheeks in delight. “For me?” she asked, her voice hushed the way one speaks of something sacred.  

“You said you liked my cloak,” I said, unfolding the fabric. It caught the fading light, the color deepening to the shade of evening skies just before the stars wake. “And since you don’t like used things, I thought you deserved one of your own.”  

She let me swing the cloak around her thin shoulders. It settled softly, wrapping her like dusk falling at the close of day. Her small hands clasped the edge, brushing its folds with reverence.  

“What’s it made of?” she asked, her voice full of longing.  

“Goose feathers and whispers from summer clouds,” I said. My voice held all the seriousness the moment deserved.

She laughed, bright and light, a chime caught in the open air. “Goose feathers alone are cruel. How thoughtful, to soften them with the kindness of clouds.”

“And what did you bring me?” I asked, invoking our ritual.  

Auri’s sly grin returned. She reached into her pocket with great deliberation and pulled out a small, weathered book. It was plain but old, its edges browned and its cover faintly embossed with swirls, like frost curling over the surface of glass.  

“This,” she announced. “It’s made of shadows and murmurs from long ago.”  

I took it carefully, running my fingers along its textured surface. It felt strangely warm, as though it had absorbed sunlight no one else could see. “What’s inside?”  

“Secrets,” she said simply. Her tone was so casual, so matter-of-fact, that it made me pause.  

“Secrets it keeps?” I asked, curious.  

“Secrets it tells,” she said, the words spreading like ripples in a still pond.  

Before I could ask more, Auri sprang to her feet, the cloak swirling around her like a storm caught in a teacup. “Play for me!” she said, twirling once, her arms spread wide.  

I pulled my lute from my pack, the familiar weight rough in my hands. The first chord rose into the air, soft and buoyant, and she began to turn, her toes brushing the stone with practiced lightness.  

The notes carried us both. My fingers guided the melody, weaving it through the cool evening air. Auri spun and spun, her bare feet tracing patterns on the rooftop as though they were writing something too beautiful for words. The stars above blurred with her motion, their light winding together with the sound of my music.  

Her laughter echoed briefly before fading into the stillness. When at last her movements slowed and my music trailed off, she collapsed into a heap of soft blue cloak and tangled golden hair, grinning up at me as though she’d captured the sky itself.  

### * * *

Denna was back in Imre.

I never know how these things find me, whether it’s an overheard word or the strange way the air changes when she’s nearby. But I knew. I felt it as surely as the first sharp note of a song.

I found her perched on a low stone wall outside a shop boasting perfumes too delicate for my palate and cigars too expensive for my purse. She was dressed simply, her dark hair dancing faintly in the breeze. But there were signs of elsewhere in her. Subtle changes tucked into the way she carried herself, secrets hinted at in the faint streak of amber kissing her hair and the soft spice clinging to her skin.

“Are you off to dine with kings?” I asked, lifting my voice just enough to break her quiet.

Her gaze found me, and she smiled, quick and sharp like light glancing off a blade. The moment vanished in the next breath. “Only if kings don’t bore me first,” she said, hopping down from the wall with just enough grace to make it seem accidental.

Something about her was different, but not in the usual way Denna was always different, like a song changing key. This was quieter, more deliberate. She was here, but I could tell that some part of her was still elsewhere, drifting outside what I could reach.

We spent the evening walking the streets of Imre, dipping in and out of gilded restaurants where the service came with silver platters and smiles just shy of condescension. I told her stories, absurd things that made her laugh, and her laugh made the night feel lighter. I played for her too, here and there. At one table, I played a simple tune, and at another, something fast and clever. Her bursts of laughter and easy smiles filled the spaces we shared, yet I couldn’t shake the weight of what always followed. It was the quiet, the part of her I could never touch.

By the time we left the last café, I’d spent more of the Maer’s coin than I cared to count. She walked at my side, her hands folded loosely behind her back, her steps as light and careless as falling leaves.

Farther down the street, the dark ribbon of the Omethi River curved its long body through the city. A light caught my eye as I noticed the lantern hanging at the bow of a small boat. Its pale glow revealed the figure of Sovoy, who was paddling along the lazy current. His movements were as smooth as ink spilling over a page. His hat was tilted forward, and his hunched shoulders made him look like an absent thought adrift in the slow water.

“That’s rare enough to catch the eye,” I murmured.  

Denna turned her head toward the water but didn’t stop walking. Her voice came softer than the river’s rhythm. “Rare things have a way of vanishing.”  

She reached for my arm and tugged me away from the café lights, leading us into quieter streets, and then quieter still, until the shadows of Imre deepened, and the soft hum of the city slipped behind us like a dying breath.  

### * * *

We found ourselves near the standing stones just beyond the far edge of the city, where the air turned sharp and stars hung closer to the ground. I had walked past these stones many times but never lingered. Tonight, though, something about their presence seemed different. The world felt quieter here, as though holding its breath.

Denna leaned against one of the stones, the faint moonlight pooling silver over her dark hair. She had her arms folded loosely, her usual laughter gentler now but no less sharp. “Why don’t you play me something new?” she asked.

It wasn’t a suggestion.

I hesitated, my fingers trailing over the strings of my lute as I unslung it from my shoulder. I wanted to reach for something easy, the steady comfort of a familiar tune, but there was no comfort in the way she looked at me. Her gaze pinned me to the spot, weightless but unyielding.

Finally, I reached for something older, an unpolished melody from days I rarely dwelled on. Its edges were rough, its rhythm uneven, like the steps of a man staggering home alone on an unfamiliar road. I had written it when I was hungry, longing both for food and for answers that were too heavy for a boy to carry.

The song spilled into the night, and Denna closed her eyes, listening. She tilted her head slightly, as if hearing something beyond the notes. When the final chords faded, she opened her eyes. For a moment, she seemed distant, as if she was farther away than the stars strung above us. Without a word, she stepped forward and brushed her lips against mine.

It was light. Fierce. Unexpected. She lingered just enough to let me feel its absence the moment she stepped back.

“I always knew you were like this,” she said softly, her voice curling into something between satisfaction and sorrow. Before I could speak, she turned toward the distant lights of Imre, the faint spice of her trailing in the breeze.

I stood there, my lute still in my hands, the silence of the stones all the more deafening in her wake. If there was anything sacred left in me, it was sitting in the space where the song had lived for just a moment longer.
