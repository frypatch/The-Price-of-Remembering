# CHAPTER 7.

## A SONG WITHOUT WORDS.


THE NEWS ARRIVED QUIETLY at first, like the faint rumble of thunder through distant hills. It moved in whispers, trailing through the Courtyards and across the stone benches of the Medica, brushing against ears and tightening brows. By midmorning, it gained weight, carried on the sharp gestures of students gathering under the shadow of the Archives.

Kilvin was Chancellor.

Those words sat like a great stone in the air. Strange. Unyielding. Kilvin of the forges, Kilvin with his heavy hands and thick voice. Kilvin who spoke carefully, who shaped fire and brass. Now seated at the high table, at the head of all things. It was hard to imagine. As if a bear had been asked to rule among books. Strong, yes. Capable. But still out of place.

I heard no proclamation. No formal announcement rang across the University. Not yet, that would come later. But the evidence was everywhere. In the Hall of Stones, Herma’s name had been carefully filed away into history. On the slab of dense, polished rock that bore the names of Chancellors past and present, Kilvin’s name gleamed freshly carved, sharp-edged like it might cut you if pressed too hard.

I saw him that morning, before Admissions. He was hunched over a long roll of parchment, thick fingers wrapped around a quill too delicate for his hand. He did not look up as I passed. I thought only of my tuition. Eighteen talents and six jots. Not the worst I’d owed, but close enough to leave a mark. Looking back, the smallness of my worries makes me wince.

Herma was gone, and Kilvin stood in his place. I imagined his voice huddled behind the weight of that long table, giving counsel in that calm, rumbling tone of his. It wasn’t a bad thought. Kilvin, after all, was what people called reliable. Still, a whisper tugged at the back of my mind like a thread. Did Kilvin know what to do when the knot unraveled?

Denna was back in Imre.

I never know how these things find me, whether it’s an overheard word or the strange way the air changes when she’s nearby. But I knew. I felt it as surely as the first sharp note of a song.

I found her perched on a low stone wall outside a shop boasting perfumes too delicate for my palate and cigars too expensive for my purse. She was dressed simply, her dark hair dancing faintly in the breeze. But there were signs of elsewhere in her. Subtle changes tucked into the way she carried herself, secrets hinted at in the faint streak of amber kissing her hair and the soft spice clinging to her skin.

“Are you off to dine with kings?” I asked, lifting my voice just enough to break her quiet.

Her gaze found me, and she smiled, quick and sharp like light glancing off a blade. The moment vanished in the next breath. “Only if kings don’t bore me first,” she said, hopping down from the wall with just enough grace to make it seem accidental.

Something about her was different, but not in the usual way Denna was always different, like a song changing key. This was quieter, more deliberate. She was here, but I could tell that some part of her was still elsewhere, drifting outside what I could reach.

We spent the evening walking the streets of Imre, dipping in and out of gilded restaurants where the service came with silver platters and smiles just shy of condescension. I told her stories, absurd things that made her laugh, and her laugh made the night feel lighter. I played for her too, here and there. At one table, I played a simple tune, and at another, something fast and clever. Her bursts of laughter and easy smiles filled the spaces we shared, yet I couldn’t shake the weight of what always followed. It was the quiet, the part of her I could never touch.

By the time we left the last café, I’d spent more of the Maer’s coin than I cared to count. She walked at my side, her hands folded loosely behind her back, her steps as light and careless as falling leaves.

Farther down the street, the dark ribbon of the Omethi River curved its long body through the city. A light caught my eye as I noticed the lantern hanging at the bow of a small boat. Its pale glow revealed the figure of Sovoy, who was paddling along the lazy current. His movements were as smooth as ink spilling over a page. His hat was tilted forward, and his hunched shoulders made him look like an absent thought adrift in the slow water.

“That’s rare enough to catch the eye,” I murmured.  

Denna turned her head toward the water but didn’t stop walking. Her voice came softer than the river’s rhythm. “Rare things have a way of vanishing.”  

She reached for my arm and tugged me away from the café lights, leading us into quieter streets, and then quieter still, until the shadows of Imre deepened, and the soft hum of the city slipped behind us like a dying breath.  

### * * *

We found ourselves near the standing stones just beyond the far edge of the city, where the air turned sharp and stars hung closer to the ground. I had walked past these stones many times but never lingered. Tonight, though, something about their presence seemed different. The world felt quieter here, as though holding its breath.

Denna leaned against one of the stones, the faint moonlight pooling silver over her dark hair. She had her arms folded loosely, her usual laughter gentler now but no less sharp. “Why don’t you play me something new?” she asked.

It wasn’t a suggestion.

I hesitated, my fingers trailing over the strings of my lute as I unslung it from my shoulder. I wanted to reach for something easy, the steady comfort of a familiar tune, but there was no comfort in the way she looked at me. Her gaze pinned me to the spot, weightless but unyielding.

Finally, I reached for something older, an unpolished melody from days I rarely dwelled on. Its edges were rough, its rhythm uneven, like the steps of a man staggering home alone on an unfamiliar road. I had written it when I was hungry, longing both for food and for answers that were too heavy for a boy to carry.

The song spilled into the night, and Denna closed her eyes, listening. She tilted her head slightly, as if hearing something beyond the notes. When the final chords faded, she opened her eyes. For a moment, she seemed distant, as if she was farther away than the stars strung above us. Without a word, she stepped forward and brushed her lips against mine.

It was light. Fierce. Unexpected. She lingered just enough to let me feel its absence the moment she stepped back.

“I always knew you were like this,” she said softly, her voice curling into something between satisfaction and sorrow. Before I could speak, she turned toward the distant lights of Imre, the faint spice of her trailing in the breeze.

I stood there, my lute still in my hands, the silence of the stones all the more deafening in her wake. If there was anything sacred left in me, it was sitting in the space where the song had lived for just a moment longer.
