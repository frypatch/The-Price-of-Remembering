# CHAPTER 46.

## THE ILLUSION OF WHOLENESS.


WE LEFT RENERE under a cloak of darkness, slipping through the eastern gate like shadows fleeing the light. Caesura was sheathed at my hip, its weight a cold reminder of everything I wanted to forget. I didn’t look back for long. The city’s walls loomed in the distance, pale and sharp as teeth in the night. It was a place that had gutted me, and I swore, as I turned my back on it, that I would never cross its threshold again.  

Bast led the way to the nearest Waystone, guiding Auri and me through unseen paths with the quiet confidence only he could muster. Crossing through the Waystone paths was a disjointed affair, the twists and turns feeling like someone had taken reality apart and put it back together wrong. Bast eased us through, and I trusted his guidance despite the unease curling at the edges of my awareness.  

We emerged closer to Imre than I thought possible, stepping into a breeze as familiar as a forgotten melody. Stonebridge rose against the deep blue of the Omethi River, and the rustle of distant voices from the far bank reminded me of the life I had once known. For a fleeting moment, it felt like coming home. And then my stomach turned. It would never be the same. Wil and Sim were gone, and their absence shadowed every street and corner. The University, once a lantern lighting my way, now seemed like only dim and fading embers.  

### * * *  

Auri led us beneath the University. She lifted a heavy grate with a smile, her small hands moving easily against the rusted metal. Her excitement flared into the air, brighter than I’d seen it in months. Her steps were light, her motions fluid, and I let her take the lead.  

“This way,” she whispered, her voice dancing like candlelight.  

I had been to the Underthing before, but not like this. She wound us through twisting passages with cryptic names: Yellow Twelve, uneven Cricklet, the shadowy halls of Mantle. Stones whispered underfoot, walls hung with faint echoes of forgotten voices. My skin prickled, not from fear but from the strangeness of it—how this place breathed beneath the world. After what felt like an eternity, Auri led us into a room carved from quiet.  

It wasn’t much: a small, round space with low ceilings and warm, flickering light. But it was hers. Every corner shone with her touch—trinkets on little shelves, treasures no one else would think to save. A bent strip of silver here, a spool of pale thread there. In one corner was a crooked shelf that caught my gaze. On top of it sat neatly arranged baubles—a brass button, a shard of glass, the bones of a story I didn’t yet know.  

“You looked so tired when you came in,” Auri said gently, her eyes soft. “Now you can stay as long as you need.”  

I couldn’t bring myself to answer. My throat tightened with gratitude, with grief. I sank into the space she had made for me, feeling more of a trespasser than a guest.  

“We’re safe now,” she said with quiet certainty, her words wrapping the room in something warm.  

I nodded slightly but didn’t trust myself to speak.  

### * * *  

For a time, things slowed. The Underthing muffled the world above, closing the door on everything that hurt. I felt myself begin to heal in small ways, though only in fragile, fleeting pieces. I would catch myself smiling—truly smiling—but it was always short-lived. Too often, the joy would curdle into loss, a cold realization dragging me down. There were moments I thought of Wil and Simon. They came unbidden, their faces stitched into my every quiet moment, reminders of things undone and words unsaid.  

Bast offered his own brand of healing, though I barely deserved it. One night, he summoned me to a small corner of Mantle with an air of practiced mystery. He produced a sliver of Fae ingenuity, muttering something under his breath in a tongue that ached to hear. I watched as the magic worked, forming the illusion of fingers where I had lost them. They looked real enough—solid, unmarred. They even wore my naming rings, glimmering faintly in the low light of the room.  

“They’re not real,” Bast said, his usual grin tempered by an edge of gravity. “But even illusions can be useful.”  

I flexed my hand experimentally, and though I didn’t feel the fingers, they moved as if responding to me. It was impressive, though it left me hollow.  

“Thank you, Bast,” I said finally, though there was no weight behind the words.  

He gave an easy shrug, but his sharp eyes lingered on me a moment too long.  

### * * *  

Much later, Auri approached me in Mantle, her head tilted to the side. “The moon was so lovely last night,” she said, as if picking a thought from thin air. “It sat so close to the world, the way an old friend might.”  

I blinked, startled by the break in the silence. “It must be nice to know the moon so well.”  

“Not as well as I know you.” She sat beside me, folding her hands neatly in her lap. “I went above last night—to see Fela.”  

I stiffened as a rush of shame spilled over me. “Fela?”  

“She needed to know about Simmon.” Her tone was light, but there was something else beneath it, something that tugged just beneath her words. She didn’t linger on the details. Auri never did. But her eyes lingered in the silence that followed, watching me carefully.  

The sharpness of her words struck me harder than they should have. Guilt roared up, raw and merciless. I should have been the one to tell Fela. It should have been *my* voice speaking Sim’s name, carrying the weight of his memory. Instead, I had spent weeks buried in the dark world beneath the University, wallowing in my failures.  

### * * *  

The next morning, I sat at the small shelf Auri had made for me, a plain sheet of paper spread before me. I wrote two letters. The first was to Wil’s family, the second to Sim’s. Each was a fragile tapestry of emotion—a steadfast refusal of the Maer’s lies woven through with trembling apologies for the part I’d played in their deaths. More than once, I had to pause, my hand shaking too much to hold the pen.  

When the letters were finished, I placed them beside me, too drained to move. Those letters stayed by my side for days, gathering dust as my resolve faltered. I thought about taking them to the families myself, thought of their faces and how they might receive me. The shame alone pinned me in place.  

Bast noticed. Of course, Bast noticed. “What are these, Reshi?” he asked, one eyebrow raised as he eyed the addressed envelopes.  

“Letters,” I said shortly, my voice distant.  

“Letters to ghosts don’t often change much.” He crouched beside me, picking one up carefully. “Do you want me to take them?”  

I opened my mouth to argue, to say this was my responsibility. But the weight of the task was already too much. I nodded stiffly, and Bast tucked the letters into his coat like they were precious.  

As he stood, he offered a small, knowing smile, a flicker of warmth lighting the edges of his features. “You’ll be all right, Reshi,” he said, though his tone carried more hope than certainty.  

I sat alone after he left, staring at the crooked shelf Auri had made for me. I thought of Wil and Sim, of Auri and Bast. And for the first time in weeks, though faint and thready, I felt the stirrings of something like hope. Something like strength.
