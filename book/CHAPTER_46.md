# CHAPTER 46.

## THE ILLUSION OF WHOLENESS.

WE LEFT RENERE under cover of darkness, slipping through the eastern gate like shadows fleeing the light. Caesura lay cold against my hip, its weight a reminder of everything I wanted to forget.  

I looked back once. The city’s walls rose dark against the stars, the White Citadel a pale finger pointing at nothing. Somewhere behind those walls, Wil and Sim lay cold. Somewhere beneath that sky, Denna was gone. I turned away and made myself a promise. I would never walk those streets again.  

Some doors, once closed, deserve to stay that way.  

Bast led us through the darkness with the confidence of someone with a misspent youth recklessly sneaking between worlds. His movements held that particular grace the Fae develop, that way of being in the world without quite touching it. Auri followed close behind me, her bare feet whispering against the stones. The moonlight seemed to remember her and welcome her home. The longer we bathed in its silver light, the more my little moon-fey returned to herself. Where she had walked, she began to skip. Where she had been silent, she began to hum.  

The Waystone waited for us like a door held dutifully ajar for their twilight prince. Standing stones carry their own silence, deep and patient and older than the names of things. This one thrummed with something more than silence. It hummed with possibility, with paths that wound through spaces where the world forgot its own rules and rewrote them in a stranger hand.  

Bast touched the stone and spoke words in the language of the Fae. The sounds were beautiful enough to break your heart and mend it in the same breath. They were the noise a harp makes when it dreams of being a voice, the sound of silver bells teaching themselves to speak.  

The sky folded like a letter being sealed. Then it folded again, like hands closing in prayer. Then we were walking through.  

The Fae paths are not roads. They are not even proper spaces. They are the memory of traveling, the dream of distance, the breath between one heartbeat and the next stretched wide enough to walk through. Colors without names painted themselves across my vision. Sounds that were almost music but not quite haunted the edges of hearing. The air tasted of copper and cinnamon, of winter mornings and summer nights, of nothing at all and everything at once.  

Time moves strangely in the Fae. It pools in some places and rushes in others, like a river that can’t decide if it wants to be a lake. But my body was learning its rhythms now. The pleasant confusion that once clouded my senses had faded. I no longer felt tired and rested in the same moment, hungry and satisfied in the same breath.  

And then, sudden as waking, we were through.  

### * * *  

The mortal world reasserted itself with the weight of a stone dropping into still water. Solid ground reached up to claim our feet. Air moved in patterns wind had taught it since the world was young. Our bodies remembered their proper weight and pulled us gently toward the earth, as if welcoming us home.  

We stood on a hill I knew as well as my own hands. Below us, the Omethi River ran its patient course, and Stonebridge stretched across the water like a promise carved in stone.  

Imre waited on the far shore, its lights glowing warm as honey, bright as hope. The sight of it struck me with the force of a blow I hadn’t seen coming. Not because it had changed. Because it hadn’t.  

The same buildings stood where they had always stood, patient as prayer. The same river ran where it had always run, constant as breathing. The same stones held the same bridge above the same water. The world had continued its turning while my friends lay cold beneath indifferent earth.  

How dare it all remain unchanged. How dare Stonebridge bear the weight of travelers as if Wil’s steady stride would ever cross it again. How dare the lights of Imre glow with the same warm welcome when Sim would never again laugh his way through those familiar streets.  

The University rose beyond the town, its towers catching the last light of day like hands cupped around a dying flame. Once it had been my entire world. My hope. My home. The desire of my heart made manifest in stone and learning. Now it was a monument to everything I had lost, every dream that had died with my friends.  

“This way,” Auri whispered, her voice dancing like candlelight in a gentle breeze.  

She led us down the hill and along the river, away from the bridge and its burden of memory. We followed a path I had never noticed despite my years of wandering. Behind a curtain of ivy that grew wild and thick and secret, she showed us a grate I would have sworn hadn’t existed until she touched it.  

The metal sang a soft note as she lifted it. Below, darkness waited.  

Auri slipped through first, moving with the certainty of water finding its way home. I followed, and the darkness welcomed me like an old friend who knew better than to mention how much I’d changed. Bast came last, pulling the grate closed above us with hands that knew the weight of secrets.  

I had walked in the Underthing before, but never like this. Never following Auri through paths that seemed to exist only for her, through passages that bent away from memory the moment you stopped looking at them. She led us through spaces I couldn’t name if I tried, past doors that sang different songs, through rooms where the darkness had different weights and textures. Some places felt old as mountains. Others hummed with secrets. One corridor smelled of lavender soap and distant bread, as if somewhere far below, ancient ovens still remembered their purpose.  

The stones whispered beneath our feet, but only to Auri’s bare soles. The walls held their breath as we passed. My skin prickled with the strangeness of walking through someone else’s secret world, a place that knew her and loved her and kept her safe.  

Eventually Auri brought us to her room of quiet comfort. It wasn’t much, this secret home beneath the world. A small, round space with ceilings low enough to make you duck your head. But warmth lived here. Light danced here. Every corner bore the mark of Auri’s careful hands. She had made this place beautiful with treasures others had cast aside. A bent strip of silver that caught the light just so. A spool of thread the color of moonlight. A button made of brass that remembered being gold.  

In one corner stood a shelf that drew my eye and held it. Carefully arranged baubles decorated its surface, each one placed just so. A shard of blue glass. The white bones of some small, secret story. Things that meant nothing to anyone but her, and therefore meant everything.  

“You are still yourself, even if you do not feel it,” Auri said, her voice gentle as spring rain. “Stay here while you find the rest of you.”  

I couldn’t find words to answer. My throat closed around all the things I wanted to say. Thank you. I’m sorry. I don’t deserve this kindness. Instead, I sank onto the floor she had prepared for me, feeling more like a trespasser than a guest in this careful, precious space.  

“We’re safe now,” she said with quiet certainty, weaving the words around us like a blanket.  

I nodded, not trusting my voice. Not trusting anything.  

### * * *  

For a time, the world grew small and quiet. The Underthing cradled us in its ancient hands, keeping the sharp edges of the world at bay. I felt myself begin to heal in the way a broken bone heals, slowly and imperfectly, leaving marks that would ache when the weather changed.  

Sometimes I would catch myself smiling at something Bast said, and for a moment the expression would feel natural on my face. Then I would remember Wil’s dry wit, Sim’s gentle laughter, and the smile would shatter like glass. Their faces haunted every quiet moment. Their voices echoed in every silence. They had died following me, trusting me, and that knowledge sat in my chest like a stone.  

Bast offered his own strange medicine for my wounds. One evening, he called me to a small alcove in the Halls of Mantle, his eyes bright with mischief and something deeper.  

“Hold out your hand,” he said.  

I did, showing him the ruin Cinder had made of it. Three fingers gone, the wounds healed but the absence screaming.  

Bast spoke words in the tongue of the Fae, words that tasted of glamour and gossamer and lies that tell the truth. The air shimmered, twisted, and suddenly my hand was whole. The missing fingers returned, perfect and unmarred. And on that hand there were rings of stone, iron, amber, wood, and bone.  

“They’re not real,” Bast said, his usual grin tempered by seriousness. “The illusion will hold as long as you don’t think about it too hard. As long as you don’t try to use them for anything that matters. But even illusions can be useful.”  

I flexed my false fingers experimentally. They moved when I thought they should move. They looked like they should look. But there was no feeling in them, no true substance. They were a beautiful lie, a glamour to hide an ugly truth.  

“Thank you, Bast,” I said, and meant it, though the words came out hollow as a broken bell.  

He shrugged with studied casualness, but his eyes lingered on my face, reading something there I couldn’t hide.  

### * * *  

Days passed in the quiet darkness. Maybe weeks. Time moves differently in the Underthing, following rules older than clocks. Then one day Auri came to me where I sat in Mantle, trying to remember how to be human.  

“The moon was lovely last night,” she said, tilting her head like a bird listening for worms. “It sat so close to the world you could almost touch it.”  

I blinked at the sudden change of subject. “You went above?”  

“To see Fela.” Her voice stayed light, but weight gathered beneath the words. “She needed to know about Simmon.”  

Shame flooded through me, hot and sick. I should have been the one to tell her. I should have climbed those stairs, knocked on her door, and spoken the words that would break her heart. Instead, I had hidden in the dark while Auri did what I couldn’t bear to do.  

“She cried,” Auri said simply. “But she cried the right way. The way that washes things clean instead of drowning them.”  

### * * *  

The next morning, if morning had any meaning in the Underthing, I sat with paper and pen and wrote two letters. One to Wil’s family. One to Sim’s.  

Each word was agony. Each sentence a confession. I told them the truth the Maer would never speak. Their sons had died as heroes, not traitors. They had stood against impossible odds with courage that would humble the greatest warriors of the old stories. They had followed me into darkness and paid the price for my failures.  

My hand shook so badly I had to stop several times. The pen slipped from my fingers. Tears spotted the letters and smudged the ink. But I finished them. I owed them that much. I owed them so much more, but this was all I had to give.  

The letters sat beside me for days, growing heavier with each passing hour. I thought about delivering them myself. I imagined standing at their doors, seeing their faces, speaking their sons’ names aloud. The shame of it paralyzed me.  

Bast noticed, because Bast noticed everything that mattered.  

“What are these?” he asked, picking up the sealed letters with careful fingers.  

“Letters,” I said, my voice flat as stone.  

“Letters to the dead don’t often change much,” he said gently. “But letters to the living sometimes do. Do you want me to take them?”  

I wanted to say no. This was my burden to bear, my duty to fulfill. But I was so tired. So broken. So empty of everything but grief and guilt.  

I nodded.  

Bast tucked the letters inside his coat like precious things. As he stood to leave, he touched my shoulder with surprising gentleness.  

“You’ll be all right, Reshi,” he said. The word was new between us, but it settled on me like a blanket. “Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.”  

After he left, I sat alone in the warm darkness of Auri’s gift. I thought of Wil and his steady strength. Of Sim and his gentle heart. Of Denna and the music we would never make together. Of Auri, who had saved me when I couldn’t save myself. Of Bast, who called me by a new name that somehow felt older than my old one.  

For the first time in weeks, faint as starlight through storm clouds, I felt something shift. It wasn’t hope, but I could see tomorrow. It wasn’t joy, but I could see a friend. And sometimes that’s enough to keep breathing. Sometimes that’s enough to keep walking.  

Sometimes that’s all we have, and somehow, it’s enough.
