# CHAPTER 03

## The Silent Toll  

The ninth bell rang, its deep tone rolling over the University like a stone dropped into a still lake. The sound swelled and spread until even the air seemed to shiver beneath its weight. It wasn’t the usual peal to mark the hour but something heavier, slower, resonant. The Iron Voice sang only for the dead. This time, it sang for Chancellor Herma.  

I stood at the water’s edge with my lute dangling from slack fingers. The river had always been quick here, its surface a patchwork of currents and reflections. But now it moved sluggishly, as if the bell had made even the water pause. My boots sank a little into the soft earth. Leaving this spot would mean the world had already moved past him, and I wasn’t ready for that.  

I knew it was coming. The signs had been there: the tremor in Herma’s hands, the halting cadence in his voice, the knots he failed to finish tying. He hinted at it himself, his departure wrapped in gentle words: *“Some knots slip, Kvothe. The world keeps spinning.”* Even so, knowing did nothing to temper the blow.  

The knowledge scraped against my chest like a dulled blade: Chancellor Herma, whose calm gaze could steady even the most chaotic tangle of threads, was gone. He’d anchored the world—not all of it, perhaps, but mine. And now, with him gone, it felt as though the air itself held its breath, waiting for something to break.  

***

The stillness of the Eolian that evening was unnatural. The tavern that usually hummed with life—brimming with song and clinking mugs—sat dulled and subdued. Even the chandeliers seemed dimmer, their waxy yellow glow hesitant to stretch far into the corners. Whispers replaced laughter, and when music did play, it faltered, as if afraid of being heard.  

Wil, Sim, and I sat at a quiet table near the back, where the shadows clung tight to the walls. Wil’s hands circled his mug, not lifting it, just holding. Sim stared into nothing, the dip of his brow deep with thought. For once, there was no comfort in the company.  

“To Herma,” Wil said finally, his voice low and gruff around the edges. He raised his mug with a kind of reverence I wasn’t used to seeing in him.  

“To a steady hand,” Sim added. His words were quieter, but I saw a tremor in the lift of his drink. He masked it quickly.  

“To a good man,” I said. My throat tightened around the words. They felt fragile, like they might crumble under their own weight. Still, I raised my mug, and we drank. The bitterness of the ale filled my mouth, but it did nothing to dull the sourness already in my chest.  

I turned my eyes to the candle burning between us. Its flame flickered even when no wind stirred, a small, uncertain thing. The wax pooled below it, gleaming like glass, ready to fall. I realized I was holding my breath, waiting.  

I hate losing things. More than that, I’m terrified of it. Herma’s death wasn’t just a loss. It was a knot left half-tied, a pattern begun but never finished. And I couldn’t stop picking at it, my mind circling back, looking for the thread that might unravel it all and make it make sense.   

***

The itch wouldn’t leave me. It followed me into the chill of the next morning, every step toward Herma’s office feeling heavier than the last. By the time I reached his door, that unease had wound itself into something tight beneath my ribs, a knot of its own.  

The door was closed, as it always was. But there, near the bottom edge, something caught my eye—a faint outline of a boot print, the tread smudged into the layer of dust framing the wood. It wasn’t his. Herma's shoes had left gentler impressions, smaller and precise. This? It was too large.  

I hesitated, my hand brushing the latch. Part of me wanted to step back and let it go. But another part—the louder part—kept pulling. Questions tugged at me, restless and insistent. The boot print wasn’t proof of anything. It could’ve been anyone. But it wasn’t. Not to me. It wasn’t anything *until I knew.*  

Murmuring a soft word of power, I flexed my Alar, and the lock, stubborn at first, relented with a faint click. The door creaked as it swung inward, a sound like it was sighing its disapproval.  

The office smelled wrong. Herma’s spaces always smelled of parchment, fresh ink, polished wood. Now the air held something colder, stale. The light pushing in through the window seemed thinner, less earnest.  

The sense of wrongness deepened as I stepped inside. His desk stood at the center of the room, papers spread awkwardly across its surface. For all his calm and care, Herma had kept a particular order to his chaos. This? It wasn’t his. A shattered inkwell lay beneath the desk, ink pooling in jagged spidering lines across the wood. Deliberate? Accidental? I couldn’t tell.  

And there, at the desk’s edge, sat the Yllish knot he’d been working on. The sight of it struck me harder than I expected. It slumped against itself, the fine threads loose and abandoned, frayed and forlorn. Herma’s fingers had been deliberate, patient. This had stopped mid-motion, a thought cut short.  

I reached out but stopped before my hands touched it. The knot itself felt like it was waiting, holding its breath. Unspoken stories clung tight to its undone threads, stories I wasn’t sure I wanted to hear.  

Instead, I moved to the desk drawers. Most were ordinary, filled with neatly stacked parchment and notes. But the last drawer resisted—a strange resistance, barely perceptible until now. Applying just the right amount of pressure, I found the false compartment behind it. There, tucked inside, was a worn leather journal.  

Herma’s handwriting greeted me on the first page, orderly at first. Lines were steady, the script clean and deliberate. But as I turned the pages, the calm gave way to chaos. The lines became jagged, the writing rushed. Words overlapped, thoughts spilling into fragments. Notations became desperate, as though he’d been racing against something unseen.  

*“Brandeur’s funds—sudden movements… residue on the gram…”*  

Each line was a thread not quite tied, pieces of a pattern that slipped through my grasp when I tried to pull them together. I tucked the journal under my cloak. Whatever this was, it wasn’t grief alone. My resolve felt no softer than the hilt of a blade pressing against my side.  

I locked the door behind me as I left.  

***

“That’s absurd.” Wil leaned back, half-hidden by the afternoon’s dim light. His voice was riddled with both frustration and something edging toward amusement. “Ink stains? Bigger boot prints? Your wild brain will have Herma chasing ghosts by morning.”  

Sim rolled a slice of apple between his fingers, studying me. “Kvothe,” he said slowly, “you’ve got this habit when it comes to loss. You start spinning threads where there aren’t any. You turn it into a puzzle because it’s better than sitting with the ache of it.”  

I stopped pacing the courtyard’s cobblestones and looked at them both, holding Herma’s journal like it was an ember in my hands. “This isn’t me seeing ghosts.” My voice tightened. I turned to Sim. “He *left me pieces.* The journal, the ink, the knot—none of it fits together.”  

Wil gave a long, rumbling groan. “When does anything ever fit together for you? Honestly, half your cleverest ideas come from stuffing square pegs into round holes.”  

Sim leaned forward, his face quieter now. “Kvothe,” he said, softer this time. “Do you really think this will lead anywhere? Or is this just…” He searched for the word. “Your way of holding on?”  

I faltered before pushing past his doubt. “This knot is different,” I said. “And I’m not letting it slip.”  

Wil groaned again. “Oh, this will end *so well.*”
