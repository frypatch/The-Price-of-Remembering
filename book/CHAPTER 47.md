# CHAPTER 47

## The Reckoning  

The Underthing was no place for Bast. He was young and eager, restless and brimming with a hunger to *do*. Expecting him to cloister himself underground, even for my sake, was selfish and unfair. I told him as much. Reassured him that he was free to leave whenever the mood struck him. But he didn’t.  

I knew why, of course. Bast was worried about me—not that I deserved it. He pretended at indifference most days, teasing me as he always had. But I could see it in the way his eyes lingered too long when he thought I wasn’t looking, the way his words sometimes faltered mid-sentence.  

I let him go topside as often as he liked, knowing he needed it. Auri had shown him the way—her strange paths through climbs and grates and hidden doors. Then, one Hepten morning, Bast came back too soon. His steps lacked their usual carefree bounce, and his bright smile had faded into something darker.  

“You look troubled,” I said, blowing absently on a bowl of porridge. “Anything the matter, Bast?”  

He hesitated, rubbing the back of his neck, his gaze flitting between me and something crumpled in his hand. “I didn’t want to bring this to you, Reshi.”  

My eyes narrowed. “Go on.”  

Bast tossed the parchment onto the table. I smoothed it out, the crude ink lines staring back at me. A face—*my* face, more or less—was splashed across the page. Beneath it, in bold lettering, I read the words:  

**“KVOTHE ‘KINGKILLER,’ SON OF ARIDEN. 100 MARKS.”**  

I snorted, sliding it away. “Nice to know I’m appreciated at such a fine price.”  

“There’s more,” Bast said, his voice lower now. “I saw him. Your old friend—the one with the stupid hat and the punchable face.”  

It didn’t take much to guess. “Ambrose.”  

Bast nodded grimly. “He’s in town, Reshi. He’s been spreading the word, whipping up anyone who’ll listen. Telling them you killed the king, that you’ve dirtied their streets with your Ruh filth.” His tone turned venomous at the last word, and his hands curled into fists.  

“That doesn’t surprise me.” I exhaled slowly.  

“He’s saying worse,” Bast continued. “He’s telling people you stole *his bride.*”  

I froze.  

“Ariel. He claims she’s his and that you’ve hidden her away like a thief. He’s promising to find her, drag you through the streets, and take her back to Renere.”  

I felt something flicker inside me—an ember catching in a dry forest. “Take me to him.”  

“Reshi, wait—”  

“I mean it, Bast. Take me to him now.”  

I didn’t think about the Lethani. I didn’t think about the University’s Codex, or the Iron Law, or any other piece of wisdom whispered to me over the years. I simply moved, guided by the single instinct I had left.  

***  

Ambrose stood in the square, right by the fountain. His entourage flanked him like a wall of polished steel, armed with swords and spears that gleamed in the sharp morning light. It was an oddly fitting place to find him—the very spot where I’d first called the wind years ago. Where I’d broken his arm and cemented our enmity.  

He was midway through a blustering tale when I stepped into view. His voice carried easily over the gathering crowd, his wide-brimmed hat dipping as he gestured and sneered. Even at a distance, I could see the smirk curling his lips.  

“I hear you’ve been looking for me,” I called out, my voice cutting cleanly through the buzzing square.  

The murmuring died, a hush sweeping over the onlookers. Ambrose stilled, his grin faltering as his eyes scanned the crowd. When he found me, the smile snapped back into place like a blade drawn too quickly.  

“You filthy Ruh bastard!” he roared, his voice trembling with hatred. “So you’ve finally shown yourself!”  

I stood unmoving, watching as he shoved through his followers to put himself at the front of the group. The gap between us remained wide, though I caught the guarded edge in his steps. He didn’t dare come too close.  

“I knew I’d find you eventually,” he hissed. “Kvothe the Arcane, murderer of kings, traitor of Vintas.”  

“I’m not here for your lies, Ambrose,” I said, my words even. “I was there. But it wasn’t me. Alveron was the one who saw it through.”  

“You lying Ruh! Nothing is ever your fault, is it?” He spat on the cobblestones. “Your blood is as filthy as your kind.”  

He reached into his pocket and took out a small vial, holding it aloft for all to see. The blood inside sloshed in the sunlight.  

I went cold.  

“Your Copperhawk was clumsy, but they served me well enough. Did you think I wouldn’t find a way to make use of this?”  

“Don’t,” I said softly, the word hanging heavy in the air between us.  

Ambrose ignored me. “Once I’ve dealt with you, I’ll take Ariel wherever I please. Renere will be delighted to see her again, I’m certain. And you? I’ll leave your body in pieces, your head on a spike for all to see!”  

I took a step forward. My voice was calm when I spoke again. *“If you do this, I will kill you.”*  

Ambrose paused. His fingers tightened around the vial, his uncertainty flickering for a brief instant. But then his smirk returned, his ego demanding a show. He unstopped the vial, dipped his fingers into the blood, and whispered a word.  

***  

I saw Ambrose feel it—the resistance. His smirk faltered, his fingers trembling as he tried to bind me. Sweat beaded on his brow as he leaned into the effort, his lips curling into a snarl.  

But I wasn’t moving. I wasn’t yielding.  

The world tightened, narrowed, until it was just him and me, locked together in this terrible, silent struggle. The binding clawed at me like thorns in a furious storm, but I stood unmoving. Against me, Ambrose was nothing. Against my Alar, he was a child holding a thread, trying to tame a maelstrom.  

“You think you can take me?” I asked, my voice low and sharp, a blade unsheathed. “You think you can *own* me with such a pathetic trick?”  

Ambrose flinched at the venom in my words, but his ego—damn his ego—steeled him. He gestured sharply, shouted another binding, his voice cracking against the tension of what he didn’t understand.  

He didn’t see it yet, but I already had his Name. It hovered there, unveiled, like a thread shimmering in the light. Fragile. Bare. His arrogance left him vulnerable—it always had. And now, he’d handed himself to me.  

“Bind him! Now!” Ambrose shouted, summoning his men as though their crude hands and ropes could finish what he could not.  

The ropes never reached me.  

I raised my arm and spoke the Name of the wind. It wasn’t shouted. It wasn’t forced. The word flowed from my throat like the strike of steel, effortless and sure.  

The air bucked and screamed, exploding outward into a cacophonous thunderclap. Ambrose’s men were thrown like ragdolls. I didn’t see where they landed. It didn’t matter.  

The crowd shrieked and stumbled back as debris flew in all directions, pebbles and dust scattering like the remnants of a broken world. But I didn’t care about the crowd. My gaze never left Ambrose.  

He staggered, his hat tumbling off his head, and for the first time, I saw real, unbridled fear bloom in his eyes.  

“Stop, Kvothe,” he said, and his voice wavered on the edge of begging. “You don’t know what you’re doing.”  

“Oh, I know *exactly* what I’m doing,” I growled, my steps slow and deliberate, each footfall cracking the ruined cobblestones beneath me. “I know you, Ambrose. I *know* you better than you know yourself.”  

I saw him shrink, his shoulders curling inward. He didn’t even run. He simply stood there, his lips trembling. He was a cornered animal now, and for the first time since I met him, I understood what that meant. Not strength. Not defiance. *Cowardice.*  

The Name came to me in perfect clarity. Ambrose’s essence—what he was, the hateful little threads that wove him together. I didn’t hesitate. I sang it.  

But the Name couldn’t stand alone. It wasn’t enough for how much fury I felt, how much he deserved this. His Name became part of a chorus: stone, air, fire, and water all wrapped around him, folding into a perfect note of unmaking. I wove him into the Names of the world, then tore the tapestry apart.  

The square erupted around him.  

The cobblestones shattered beneath his feet. The great stone fountain hissed and cracked, steam rising as the water burned itself to death. The very air around us shuddered, waves of pressure rolling outward. For a moment—just a moment—the sky itself darkened, the light winking out as though it couldn’t bear to witness what I’d done.  

Ambrose screamed, but it wasn’t a human sound. It was raw and piercing, a final note before the chorus consumed him. And then, silence.  

The square stilled. My throat burned like acid, and I stumbled, my knees threatening to buckle. But I steadied, locking my legs beneath me. I had to see. I had to look.  

Less than nothing was left of him. The crowd stood frozen, their faces pale, and as I turned to them, I saw myself reflected in their eyes. There wasn’t admiration or belief there. Not even anger. Only terror.  

I saw familiar figures among them. Elodin stood like a statue, his face unreadable except for the terrible weight in his eyes. And Fela… Fela looked at me with open revulsion, as though she didn’t recognize me at all.  

Their gazes burned into me. My chest felt hollow. My throat stung. I couldn’t stay.  

So, I ran.
