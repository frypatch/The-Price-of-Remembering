# CHAPTER 48.

## A TRAP OF MEMORY.


A SIGH FILLED THE Waystone Inn. Kote sat forward at the table, shoulders curved inward, elbows on his knees, hands clasped like a man at prayer or penance. He nodded to himself once, twice, as if settling an old argument.  

“And the rest,” Kote said with quiet reverence in his voice, “is what you’d expect.” A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth, as though at some private jest. “We had prices on our heads. People asking questions. So there we were. Gone.”  

“Disguises,” Bast added from his corner, spitting the bitter word from his tongue.  

“Disguises,” Kote agreed. His fingers found the table’s grain, tracing it like a map to nowhere. “Different names. Different faces. This time I went looking for a place so small that even memory might overlook it. A place between nowhere and nothing.”  

Chronicler’s pen scratched against parchment with the steady rhythm of rain on leaves.  

“But leaving takes more than just walking away. Leaving properly, leaving completely, that requires things.” He raised two fingers, counting off necessities like a merchant tallying debts. “Money first. Enough for horses, for food, for tools. Enough to build this place from the ground up.” He lowered one finger. “Second, a clean break. No loose threads to follow, no trails to track.”  

“The morning before we left, I went back to the University,” Kote began again, his voice reverting to the storyteller’s cadence of the last three days. “Dawn was just breaking, and the sun was rising fast enough to make sticking to shadows difficult. So I took the forgotten ways, the servant stairs and maintenance passages. Basil happened to be at Stocks that morning.” He paused, considering. “Call it luck. Call it fate. Call it the turning of a card. Whatever name you give it, the timing served me well.”  

Kote’s hand settled on the table, fingers drumming once, twice, then falling still. “The Stainless had done well enough. Better than I’d hoped, truth be told. But the Bloodless?” He shook his head slowly. “Those were worth their weight in gold. Maybe more. The East was drowning in troubles then. Coups and rebellions and broken crowns scattered across marble floors. When people are afraid, they’ll pay anything for the promise of safety. Fear opens purses wider than greed ever could.”  

He paused, letting his words settle onto the Chronicler’s page.  

“The irony wasn’t lost on me,” Kote continued, awkwardly opening his hands forward. “Making coin from chaos I’d helped create.”  

He shifted in his chair, the wood creaking a complaint. “After I’d emptied Stocks of every bent bit and broken drab, I did something foolish. I went to Kilvin’s office.” He shrugged. “Stupid, I know. But I couldn’t leave without saying goodbye. Some habits die harder than others.”  

“And?” Chronicler prompted when the silence stretched too long.  

“And nothing. His forge was cold. His desk drawer stood open. Knowing Kilvin, I suspect he expected my visit. Some messages don’t need letters.”  

Another pause. Another scratch of quill on parchment.  

“What came next?” Chronicler asked.  

“What came next?” Kote’s gaze drifted upward, tracing the dark beams overhead as if reading words written there. He gestured around the common room with one hand. “I built this. Every board and nail. Every stone in the foundation. Every clever hinge and hidden compartment.”  

He spread his hands flat against the table, the gesture both offering and surrender. “This is what I made of myself. This is what became of Kvothe. Do what you will with the story.”  

The silence rushed back in, filling every corner of the room. The fire in the hearth whispered secrets to itself, and somewhere in the cellar walls, old stones settled with a collective groan.  

Chronicler carefully set down his last surviving quill. His mouth opened, closed, opened again. Words gathered and scattered like startled birds.  

“There’s something you want to ask,” Kote said. It wasn’t a question.  

“Several things,” Chronicler admitted. “When you said you left Imre, you said ’we.’ Bast came with you, obviously, but what about Princess Ariel?”  

Kote’s hand tightened around his mug until his knuckles went white. “Safe,” he said, the word sharp and final as a key turning in a lock. “That’s all you need to know.”  

Chronicler nodded, accepting the boundary like a man acknowledging a fence. “And Folly?”  

Kote’s gaze climbed to the sword mounted above the bar. In the firelight, the blade seemed to shimmer with colors that had no names. “She was my attempt at an apology,” he said after a long moment. “There’s an art to making a sword, and I got most of it right. The balance. The edge. The weight.” He gestured vaguely at the blade. “But the color is wrong. Maybe something in the fold of the metal. Maybe something in the quenching. Maybe just my own failure following me even there.”  

“You made her yourself?”  

“I owed them that much. The Adem.” Kote’s voice carried weight beyond the words. “Her shape isn’t quite right for their style, but her edge is true. She waits here for them, for when all of this is over.”  

The room fell silent again, but it was a different silence now. Expectant. Watching.  

“You want to see it,” Kote said flatly.  

“Your hand,” Chronicler replied, trying for casual and missing by miles.  

Without ceremony, Bast rose from his corner and moved to Kote’s side. His fingers worked at something invisible, and the air around Kote’s left hand shimmered and fell away like water. What remained made Chronicler’s breath catch.  

Three fingers gone entirely. The rest twisted and scarred, pale rivers of damaged flesh running across what remained.  

Kote flexed what remained of his hand, the movement awkward and incomplete. “Some mornings I wake and they’re still there. I can feel them. I can almost move them.” His voice was distant, contemplative. “Memory plays cruel games. Success wounds, but failure cuts to the bone.”  

“That’s not how I see it,” Chronicler said quietly.  

Kote’s laugh was bitter as burnt coffee. “How you see it doesn’t matter. Look around you. Everything I touched turned to ash. Every path I walked crumbled behind me. So spare me your philosophy.”  

Chronicler stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. His voice rose, trembling with something between anger and desperation. “No. Look at this place. Every beam you carved. Every stone you set. You built this with your own hands. And everything that came before wasn’t luck or tragedy. It was you. The hero of Trebon. The man who faced down princes. You’re still Kvothe, whether you want to remember it or not.”  

The innkeeper said nothing. His dark green eyes lingered a moment longer before sinking into the shadow of himself.  

Silence claimed the room.  

The door creaked open.  

A figure stood in the doorway. He was thin, hunched, and pale, with wisps of white hair clinging stubbornly to his liver-spotted scalp. His shadow sprawled across the doorway, stretching unnaturally long in the flickering lamplight of the inn.

Kote straightened slightly, his green eyes narrowing beneath the shadow of his hair. He placed the tankard on the bar with deliberate care, the soft clink as it met the wood betraying nothing of the swirling unease gathering in his gut. “We’re closed,” he said evenly, his voice calm but carrying an edge that no one who knew Kvothe would mistake for mere politeness.

The man stepped forward, his soft-soled shoes brushing the floorboards with a faint scrape. “Closed to weary souls? Surely not,” he said, his voice matching his appearance: dry, brittle, and just a touch too thin. “Have a heart, friend. I’ve traveled long and far beneath a cold moon. Can’t a poor man share a piece of your fire?”

Kote tilted his head, considering him. Those black eyes glimmered in the dim light like wet stones, watching him too closely, lingering too long. There was something in the way the man moved, in the awkward, almost lurching rhythm of his unsteady steps, that struck Kote as just slightly wrong. The faintest sliver of a frown carved its way onto his face.

He let the air hang heavy between them for a moment longer before finally speaking. “I suppose it’s no trouble. Have a seat,” Kote said, gesturing to one of the scarred wooden tables nearest the hearth. His voice carried an easy cadence, as if this were the most mundane of exchanges. But his hands, unseen beneath the bar, had unconsciously balled into fists. “I can fix you something to eat. There’s not much left at this hour, though.”

The man shuffled farther into the room, each step slow and measured, as though he were feeling his way forward. He dragged one hand across the back of a chair as he passed, his fingers curling over the wood like pale claws. “Beet soup, perhaps?” he asked, cocking his head like a crow amused by its own question.

Kote’s brow furrowed ever so slightly. There it was again, that thread of something strange in the man’s tone. He turned his head toward Bast, who had been leaning in the corner, his dark eyes sharp and predatory. “Bast,” Kote said, his voice steady as stone and utterly devoid of the warmth he’d offered his guest. “Our friend here could use something warm to eat. Take care of that, and while you’re at it, switch out the barrels in the cellar. They’ll need a firm hand tonight. Devon can help with that.”

Bast blinked once, his expression unreadable save for the subtle clench of his jaw. “Of course, Reshi,” he said at last, his tone calm, though the edges of his words wavered just enough for someone like Kote to notice. His gaze flicked momentarily to the strange newcomer, and then he moved toward the stairs, his fluid steps betraying none of the tension in his wiry frame.

Chronicler followed after him, his confusion plain. “Barrels?” he muttered quietly before the cellar door swung closed behind them, the latch clicking into place.

Kote’s attention slid back to the pale man, who now hovered near the bar. The man’s posture had grown just a bit straighter, and for the briefest moment, something flickered in his eyes—something sharp, something knowing.

“Can I get you a drink while you wait?” Kote asked, his casual manner returning, though the corners of his mouth remained tight.

The man glanced back at the shelves of bottles behind the bar, then smiled. It was a strange smile—thin, deliberate, and far too pleased for the circumstances. “A beer, if it’s not too much trouble.”

“Not at all,” Kote said, already reaching for a tankard. His left hand brushed the shelf beneath the counter, and there, his fingers found the cool leather grip of something much heavier than a beer mug. “You seem… familiar,” he added lightly, keeping his voice smooth as he turned toward the kegs. He began pouring the beer, the faint hiss of liquid breaking the tense silence. “Have we met before? You might remind me of someone.”

“Perhaps,” the man replied, his airy tone making the word seem like a wisp of smoke. “Far and away, perhaps. Time has a way of blurring faces, does it not?”

“True enough,” Kote said, sliding the filled tankard across the bar. But his smile, though faint and polite, didn’t reach his eyes. “Funny thing, though. Time usually doesn’t blur a smile quite like yours.”

Something flickered across the man’s face—a momentary ripple that didn’t quite fit his composed demeanor. He took a long sip from the tankard, his eyes on Kote’s the entire time. When he set the glass down, his smile had returned, wider now, his lips curling like the blade of a knife.

“Ah,” the man said softly, his voice lingering in the air like the chill of night. “And here I thought you might have forgotten me.”

The world froze for an impossibly long moment. And then, in a blur faster than the eye could follow, Kote’s hand lashed out—strong, precise, and utterly merciless.

The blow hurled the old man backward. He slammed through a table with an ear-splitting crack, scattering wooden shards across the floor. For a moment, his body lay motionless in a heap, limbs bent at odd angles.

Kote’s breath was steady as he flexed the fingers of his right hand, steam rising from the bare, scarred flesh. Slowly, he unraveled the rag that had been wrapped around it, revealing the battered knuckle dusters beneath.  

“You,” Kote said quietly, his voice low and stiff as gravel beneath a boot.  

The crumpled figure on the floor began to shift, laughter bubbling up like blood from a wound. It was louder now, deeper, and colder. “Little rabbit,” the man hissed.  

Kote’s face was impassive. He turned and pulled Folly from its perch on the mounting board. The weight of the sword settled into his hands as if it had been waiting for this moment.  

“I was wondering when you’d show up, Cinder,” Kote said, his voice bitter. “You’re early.”

The figure rose, flickering and shifting. The old man’s body melted away like frost under sunlight, replaced by something sharper, crueler. White hair fell around a pale, angular face. Silver-blue eyes shone with an unnatural light, and his grin stretched unnaturally wide.  

“So clever, little rabbit. Did you miss me?” Cinder’s voice was sharp, like glass shattering, and threaded with mockery.  

“We’ll see who’s clever,” Kote muttered, stepping toward the wall. He pulled a hidden handle, and the inn answered. Iron bars crashed down over the windows and door with a scream of metal on wood. The hearth roared to life, its flames leaping high and wild, casting chaotic shadows across the room.  

Kote raised his burned hand, smoking and trembling. In his fingers, he held a single lump of coal. His voice was low, faint, but steady. “Ferula. I bind you. By the name of stone, be still as stone.”  

Cinder’s movements faltered, his limbs locking in place as though he had been trapped in amber. His grin never faltered, but his eyes burned with hate. “You’re playing a dangerous game,” he said, his tone shifting from mocking to icy.  

“I know,” Kote replied. Without another word, he disappeared into the cellar.  

### * * *

“Charred body of God, what’s going on up there?” Bast hissed, his sharp voice cracking as he met Kote at the bottom of the basement stairs. His pupils were wide and wild, his usually unshakable confidence gone.  

“It’s Cinder. He’s here,” Kote replied, his tone quiet and clean. No wasted words, no fear. His green eyes flicked over Bast and then to Chronicler, standing wooden and pale nearby. “I’ve slowed him, but we need to go.” He pointed to the far side of the room. “The cellar hatch. It’ll take us out to the stables.”  

Bast moved instantly, bounding over the barrels to reach the hatch like a cat stirred to urgency. “A hand!?” he barked, glaring at Chronicler, who seemed frozen in place.  

Chronicler flinched before fumbling forward, his fingers shaking as they wrapped around the heavy iron batten. With a grunt, he lifted it, casting it aside. It hit the wall with a reverberation that rolled along the stone walls and floor. Bast didn’t wait. He threw the hatch open, shoving Chronicler up the steps with impatient strength.  

Kote trailed them to the foot of the stairs, watching silently.  

Chronicler had barely cleared the opening when Bast turned, freezing in place. His face twisted with disbelief as Kote reached forward, his hands steady and his movements deliberate. The innkeeper grasped the thick iron bar and swung it down with a single hard motion. The latch clicked into place, the sound definitive as a snapped string.  

“Reshi!” Bast’s voice cracked, loud and raw, as he slammed his hands against the hatch doors. “Reshi, what are you doing?”  

Kote leaned his weight against the locked door for a long, still moment. When he spoke, it was with a voice as calm as still water. “Go, Bast. Take Devon and run.”  

“Reshi, no! Don’t do this!” Bast pounded harder, and the impact sent small eruptions of dust from the seams of the wood, scattering like tiny stars in the pale lamplight. “OPEN THIS! Reshi, damn it, please!”  

Kote closed his eyes for a breath, his face unreadable. Then he turned from the door and moved toward the stairs leading back into the common room. Behind him, Bast’s voice broke, spilling anguish into the dark.  

“Don’t leave me...”  

The words hung there, trembling, but the innkeeper didn’t pay any heed. Instead, he made his way back to the stairs leading up into the common room. From his pocket, he pulled two small cubes of dull, blackened metal. Their appearance was plain, but they rang faintly against each other in his hand, a sound too high and sweet for their weight.  

He crouched near the doorway and placed the cubes on the floor—one to the left, one to the right. No wasted motion. His fingers lingered on them as he muttered soft words under his breath, his voice just a thread against the thickening air.  

The room shifted the moment he finished. The weight in the air tightened further, like a drawn bowstring. The fire stuttered and leaned sideways for half a breath, then surged back with a roar. The trap was set—silent, invisible, waiting.  

Kote stood, already turning toward the chest near the forge. His gaze locked on it, a flicker of tension shadowing his otherwise controlled expression. Dust sifted from the ceiling as the boards above him creaked under heavy boots. Each step was slow and deliberate, and the sound set his teeth on edge.  

He reached the chest in three strides. His hands moved automatically now, unhooking the ring of keys from the nearby shelf. The copper key first, fitting into the first lock with a satisfying click. The next lock turned with iron.  

Another step overhead. Louder this time, closer. The distinctive creak of the staircase at the far end of the common room.  

Kote’s hand hesitated on the third lock for the briefest instant, his knuckles tightening. He inhaled once, sharply, and forced his focus back to the task at hand.  

The steel key slid home. The lock clicked—louder this time, almost like an accusation. The last tumbler gave, but the lid didn’t move.  

Of course it didn’t.   

Kote straightened, his head tilting slightly toward the stairs. Cinder was here. He could feel him, as though the man’s shadow stretched ahead to brush against his skin. The footsteps drew closer, the creaking announcing each one like the toll of a bell.  

Kote turned back to the chest, his breath tighter now. His throat felt dry. His fingers flexed once at his sides, then he let the words come—quiet, as though he feared even the walls would hear.  

“I am Kvothe.”  

The lid didn’t stir. Dust settled. The silence thickened.  

Kote’s lips tightened and he whispered again, fiercer this time. “I am Kvothe.”  

The golden insignia on the lid gleamed faintly for half a heartbeat. But still, nothing. The chest remained closed.  

The boots reached the first step of the staircase leading down into the common room.  

Kote’s jaw clenched. His voice, lower and rougher now, broke the air.  

“I *am* Kvothe.”  

The lid of the chest stirred, then slowly swung open, revealing a light too sharp and raw to be just light. It burned golden, yes, but there were cracks of something else within it: strands of emerald and threads of pale, flickering violet. It wasn’t clean. It wasn’t smooth. It was alive, spilling out unevenly like a bloodstain spreading across linen.  

As the light touched him, Kote inhaled, his chest rising as though breathing for the first time in years. His scars didn’t fade, but something in the way he stood now felt straighter, sharper. A tension he’d carried for years seemed to melt away.  

For the first time in too long, Kvothe smiled—not a faint shadow of a smile, but something real and dangerous.  

“Thank you,” he whispered to the chest, his voice quiet but steady. There was no time for more.  

The boots reached the stone floor of the common room. Behind him, the air turned cold, heavy with malice.  

Kvothe stood, his back straightening fully as he turned to face the shadow that awaited him.
