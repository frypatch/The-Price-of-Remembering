# CHAPTER 5

## THE ART OF LISTENING  

I LINGERED OUTSIDE THE Archives after the trial. I didn’t plan to—my feet had drifted there on their own, as if pulled by some unseen thread. The quiet pressed in, thick as wool soaked in water. Each breath I took felt heavier, as if the walls themselves tightened the air around me. Somewhere, faint and far off, a bell sounded its hollow hum, softened by distance and stone.

The silence had its own weight. It bore down on me as if it meant to smother everything else—the unanswered questions, the loose ends, the gnawing edges of guilt that clung tighter than I wanted to admit.

“You’ve been thinking too loud.”

I turned and found Elodin standing there, framed by the shadows of the passage behind him. He didn’t so much stand as inhabit the space, like he had been part of that silence all along and had simply chosen now to emerge from it. His robe hung crooked, one shoulder bare. His hair was as wild as his expression was calm, eyes bright as cut glass but unreadable, like they reflected some light I couldn’t see. For an instant, as my gaze met his, I thought there was something strange about the way the shadows moved around him, like they leaned into his edges instead of away. But the moment passed before I could pin it down.

“Walk with me,” he said. There was no inflection to his tone—no invitation. It wasn’t rude. It just assumed.

Then he smiled, small and sly, as though he’d just told a joke only he was clever enough to hear. Before I could answer, he turned and began moving along the uneven cobbles, his steps an easy glide. I didn’t even have to think before my feet followed.

Elodin wove through the campus like the wind: careless but deliberate. Cobblestones gave way to gravel, gravel to dirt as we twisted beneath low archways and tight alleys, past buildings bathed in shadow. I couldn’t say if he led us by instinct or some private knowledge of paths no one else noticed. Whatever the case, the ground felt uneven beneath my boots, but Elodin walked over it like it wasn’t there.

At last, he broke the silence. “You’re thinking about Herma.” He didn’t ask. His tone was like clockwork: measured, inevitable.

“Of course I am,” I said, though the words felt too clumsy for the weight I meant them to carry. “It feels… wrong. Too quick. Like rushing through a verse before the final chord has time to settle.”

Elodin hummed lightly in response, but there was no trace of melody in it—just a low vibration, faint and faintly odd. “He hated chaos,” he said, soft and almost to himself. “But not in the way you might think. Herma hated what chaos did to people. Books and ropes and rooms can handle disorder—they’re simpler things. People aren’t. He tied things together, Kvothe.”

I frowned at him. “Tied how?”

Elodin’s lips curved slightly, like I’d stepped onto the edge of some verbal trap. “Have you never noticed it? The scholars, the errant students, the fools trying to wrap themselves in wisdom too large for them? Herma pulled at their ends. Drew them steady. Anchored them. You never even saw it. Not until now.”

“And now?” I asked, careful.

He didn’t smile this time. Instead, he glanced up at the sky, where the clouds had begun unraveling into long threads of mist across the sky. “Now his knots are loose. Some tighter than others. But I wonder: which ones will prove permanent?” 

We walked on. When the cemetery came into view, I realized for the first time where Elodin had been leading me.  

### * * *

The grave seemed wrong somehow. Not because it lacked grandeur—Herma never wanted grandeur—but because it ended too neatly. Flat stone, straight edges, clean lines. Where was the knot? The thing that gave it meaning, complexity, weight? It was no grave for a man as full of untied stories as Herma had been. Chaos without the song.  

Elodin stood silently, his posture uncharacteristically still. His energy, usually crackling with whimsical chaos, seemed subdued now, his shoulders faintly bent under some invisible weight. After a time, he broke the silence, low and tentative, as if careful not to disturb the grave itself.  

“The art of listening,” he said, “is more than Naming. You already know this. Even if you don’t know you know it.”  

Did Elodin know I’d had a hand in Hemme’s downfall? Had Kilvin woven together my loose threads? But as I opened my mouth, I felt the air itself pressing against my words. I let them fall away. The answer wouldn’t change anything.  

Elodin stayed a moment longer, murmuring something that felt more like a prayer than a comment. Then he turned and walked away, leaving me there with my thoughts and the weighted silence of the burial ground.  

### * * *

That night, Elodin’s Naming class was the opposite of the graveyard. Where the grave had been still, the class crackled with restless energy. Firelight from the torches danced across the stone walls, throwing shadows that writhed like living things.  

“Kvothe.” Elodin’s voice cut through the air, snapping my name like a bowstring. “To the center.”  

I hesitated, but only for a heartbeat. Every eye in the room traced my movements as I stepped forward. I stood in the circle of space Elodin had carved out for moments like this, beneath the heavy gaze of ancient stonework and brighter, watchful eyes.  

Elodin paced slow circles around me, his movement oddly graceful, like a bird inspecting its prey after deciding it wasn’t, in fact, dead. “Tell me,” he said quietly. “What do you see in a Name?”  

His tone was too calm, too deliberate, and I braced myself. “I see truth,” I replied, my voice measured, even.  

Elodin stopped pacing. The faintest smile curved along his lips. “Clever. And true enough. But truth is not simple. It is not clean.” He began to move again, circling me steadily. “Truth is layered, Kvothe. A fragile thread wrapped in lies, in doubt, in sharp things eager to snap under tension.”  

I opened my mouth to respond, but Elodin wasn’t waiting.  

“And a Name,” he continued, “isn’t just truth. It is balance, connection, weight. It’s the thing beneath all things.” He stopped suddenly, fixing me with a bright, piercing gaze. “Pull too hard at one thread…” He waved his hand, and a faint wind stirred through the room. It wasn’t much, just a soft breeze brushing my face. “And it all unravels.”  

The air thickened. I could feel it winding tighter around me, impossibly heavy.  

Elodin leaned closer, his voice soft as silk. “Say it.”  

The Name hovered on the edge of sense, spinning just beyond my reach. And then, like plucking a string I couldn’t see, it rang through me. Not as sound exactly, but as a trembling resonance that pulled through my chest and fingers. The wind moved, shifting in perfect harmony with the name I didn’t so much call as breathe. A melody hidden within silence, waiting to be played.  

For a moment, it lingered at my side, light as breath, alive with motion. Then, thin as glass, it formed a ring around my finger before dissolving.  

The room fell still. Papers that had scattered in the sudden wind settled softly to the ground. No one spoke.  

"Beautifully done,” he said, his tone a strange mix of reverence and regret. He stepped closer, tilting his head like a bird both curious and wary. “A ring of air. A rare thing. The first step toward something.” He hesitated, studying the space where the wind had been, then nodded faintly. “A pity. So lovely. So doomed.”

I barely heard him. I was still caught in the moment before—held captive by the raw, fragile truth of what I’d just touched. It wasn’t just a moment, nor a trick. It was proof that I had crossed some invisible line.
