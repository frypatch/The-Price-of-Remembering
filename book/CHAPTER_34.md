# CHAPTER 34.

## COMMAND IN THE CHAOS.


THE MANGONEL GROANED AS Fascino’s men readied the first strike. Its massive arm was drawn back, ropes straining and creaking as if the machine itself despised the work it was about to do. They loaded a stone into the sling, a stone as large as a child, and in my chest, the ember of hope guttered low, flickering like a candle in a sudden breath of wind.  

“We don’t have the defenses for this.” The words slipped out bitter and thin. I let my back rest against the cold stone wall. Every movement sent a fresh ache through my shoulder, a reminder of its cost, a reminder of how little I had left to give.  

Wil’s hand landed on my good shoulder, firm and grounding. “What is it?” His voice was tight, every syllable carved sharp.  

“They’re bringing a mangonel,” I said, the words tasting of failure. “If they strike true, this tower is gone.”  

Wil’s curse was quiet but rough, like a stone scraping against another. Across the room, Sim heard the edge in my voice. He turned toward us, his face pale, but his step steady.  

“Tehlu spare us,” Sim murmured, stepping to the arrow slit. He looked through it in silence, his lips pressed thin as he took in the sight of the siege engine. He stood still for a moment, shoulders slack, gaze distant. He was lost in the same place I was, where the walls were crumbling and no good choices remained.  

But then Sim straightened. He set his shoulders as if lifting a weight that could not be seen. He let out a slow breath that felt like the sharpening of a blade.  

“No,” he said. The word struck clean and sharp. “We’re not done. Not yet.”  

Wil arched an eyebrow, voice dry as dust. “I’m not sure what you’re seeing that we aren’t, friend.”  

Sim turned to face him, and something fierce had kindled in his eyes. The fire there was a stranger to Sim’s gentle face, but it burned all the same. “We still have arrows. Oil. Pitch.” He gestured toward the few guards gathered near the wall. “You’ve faced worse odds on the frontier, haven’t you?”  

Wil’s eyebrow lifted again, and though his mouth shaped into something wry, there was no mockery in his tone. “Barely,” he said, but his eyes were watching Sim differently now, as if measuring him anew.  

Then Sim looked at me.  

“Kvothe,” he said, and my name sounded like an oath. “I’ll need you on the Wind.”  

I stared at him. Pain and weariness blurred the edges of the world, and his words seemed distant, as if they were meant for someone stronger. “I—Sim, I don’t know if I can.” My hands trembled, slight but unsteady, and my breath caught on the edge of what I did not want to say. That calling the Name of the Wind might break me more than it broke our enemies.  

Sim stepped closer, his voice softer now. “You don’t have to stop it. Just slow it down. A glancing blow. That’s all we need. A little time.”  

Time. That was all we were ever grasping for. Time measured not in hours but in moments, fragile and fleeting, to be stolen in the space between heartbeats. He wasn’t asking for the world. He wasn’t asking for a miracle. He was asking for me.  

There was something in his voice. It was not desperation. It was belief.  

I drew a breath, sharp and thin, and pulled myself upright. My body ached, but it obeyed. “Alright,” I said. “Do what you can down here.”  

### * * *

“Wil,” Sim said, already striding toward the guards who had not yet found their purpose. “Take three men. You’ll get the oil down. That comes first. Tip the cauldron straight over the courtyard when I give the word. No half measures. I don’t care if it spills across their shields.”  

Wil answered with a mocking salute, all flourish and grin, but he gathered the men without another word. “On it, Commander Sim.” His voice still held its familiar edge of wit, but his steps rang sharp with purpose.  

Sim turned to the others, the handful of guards still standing in the room, still caught between doubt and duty. “You two. Every bolt. Every arrow. Gather them all. If it flies, we shoot it. Aim for the siege crew. No excuses. No mercy. Not one of them leaves without an arrow in their gut. Do you understand?”  

The men nodded. Their faces were pale and strained, the look of men unused to clear commands. They were used to being shouted at, shoved about by men too drunk to remember what orders they had given a breath before. Sim did not shout. He was not barking them into line. He was giving them something to hold on to.  

Even King Roderick sat silent, watching Sim with an expression I could not easily name. There was pride in it, sharp and clean. But there was something quieter beneath. Something slow and heavy. Something shaped like guilt.  

Sim met my eyes, and for a moment the question hung between us. Would it be enough?  

We did not give it voice. We did not need to. We both knew the answer. It did not have to be enough. It only had to buy us time.  

### * * *

The first stone launched.  

I was waiting. My hand pressed flat against the cold wall, feeling the sure weight of it beneath my fingers. The stone was steady. The stone was still. I let its stillness settle the unsteady churn of my thoughts as I reached for the Wind.  

It came slow, reluctant, like luring a shy animal from the brush. My body was too battered, my mind too frayed, to summon it with the sharpness I wanted. But Sim had been right. I did not need sharpness. I needed to be careful. I needed to be exact.  

When I spoke the Name of the Wind, my voice was no stronger than a breath, but the world listened.  

The air twisted outside the tower, a breath held in the throat of the world, just before the stone arrived. The great weight of it tilted. Not much. Barely enough to notice. But enough. Enough to shift its path away from the heart of the tower. The stone struck the outer parapet instead. Stone shattered. Shards of it rained down like knives. The impact rippled through the tower, rattling its bones, rattling mine. My legs buckled. I fell into the wall, clinging to it for balance, for breath.  

Sim was at my side in a heartbeat. His hand found my arm, holding me upright. “You did it,” he said. His voice could not decide whether to believe it.  

“I slowed it,” I said. My voice was cracked and thin. “That is all.”  

He looked at me as if that were enough. “You bought us time.”  

Then he was gone again, sprinting back toward the defenders. Above us, Wil’s voice rang out. “Oil’s ready!” His shout cut through the stone and smoke. A moment later, I heard the hiss of boiling liquid, the sharp crackle as it met air. Then came the roar. A rush of sound that filled the courtyard, the hungry voice of fire finding its feast.  

### * * *

Through the narrow arrow slit, I watched Fascino’s crew scatter beneath the falling fire. The boiling oil had fouled the cranking mechanism, and one of the men at the mangonel stumbled back, his arm aflame. He clutched at the blackened flesh as he fell, his screams cutting sharp against the chaos below. The siege engine would not fire so swiftly now.  

But it still stood. The engine itself was not yet broken.  

Wil returned, breath tight, sweat beading his brow. “That’s their last clean volley for a while,” he said. His voice lost a bit of its edge when he glanced at me. “If you’re going to play with Names again, try not to die before the rest of us.”  

“They’re still loading,” Sim muttered. His face had grown dark.  

I stepped forward. The world wavered around me, but I moved anyway. “One more,” I rasped. The mangonel’s crew were gathering themselves, cranking the stiffened mechanism with grim determination. They worked slower now, but they worked still. My shoulder pulsed with every heartbeat, but that familiar, foolish fire inside me flared hotter than the pain. “I’ll get one more shot.”  

I reached for the Wind again, though my mind trembled on the verge of breaking.  

Before I could summon it again, Sim’s hand caught my arm.  

“No,” he said, his voice sharp and certain. “They’ll keep coming. You’ll burn out too quickly. We need to try something else.”  

“What else is there?” I rasped. My breath came rough and uneven, tearing at my throat.  

“You bought us time,” Sim said. “It’s enough for one counterstrike before they gather themselves. Let me figure out the rest.”
  
I sagged back against the wall as Sim turned away, his voice rising to call fresh orders to the defenders who still remained. I let my eyes slip half-closed. I was not resting. I was counting heartbeats.  

Outside, Fascino’s voice cut through the din, smooth as silk, sharp as a blade.  

“Still standing, are you?” he called. “Your tower’s a corpse on its feet. Look around you. Tell me, was this worth it?”  

I gave him no answer. What was the point of trading words with a man who pretended to stand above the ruin when his world was crumbling just like mine?  

Instead, I turned back to the others, the ones preparing for the next assault. Blood had begun to seep through the bandages on my shoulder, slow and steady. My voice, when it came, was soft but certain, meant only for Sim.  

“Whatever you need, I’ll still be here.”
