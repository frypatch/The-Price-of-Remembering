# CHAPTER 34

## COMMAND IN THE CHAOS  

THE MANGONEL CREAKED AS Fascino’s men prepared the first strike, its massive arm drawn taut against ropes groaning under the strain. They loaded a stone the size of a small child into the sling, and I felt the ember of hope in my chest flicker dangerously low.

“We don’t have the defenses for this,” I muttered bitterly, sagging back against the cold stone wall. Pain radiated from my shoulder with every slight movement as though reminding me of its presence, its cost.

Wil’s hand fell heavily onto my good shoulder. “What is it?” he said, his voice clipped and serious.

“They’re bringing a mangonel,” I said, the taste of failure bitter in my mouth. “If they hit us with that, this tower is done.”

Wil cursed under his breath, his voice low and ragged. From across the room, Sim caught the tone in my voice as he hurried toward us, his face pale but his posture firm. 

“Tehlu spare us…” Sim looked out of the narrow arrow slit. His lips tightened as he took in the sight of the siege engine and the soldiers surrounding it. For a brief moment, he seemed lost. Just like I was.

Then Sim set his shoulders and exhaled slowly.

“No,” he said sharply, his voice like steel scraping flint. “We’re not done. Not yet.”

Wil raised an eyebrow. “I’m not sure what you’re seeing that we aren’t, friend.”

Sim turned to him, fire alight in his normally soft eyes. “We still have arrows. Oil. Pitch.” He gestured briskly at the handful of guards. “You’ve fought worse odds on the frontier, haven’t you?”

Wil’s eyebrow arched again, but some part of him seemed startled—and maybe annoyed—by Sim’s sudden command. “Barely,” he said dryly, but there was no mockery in his tone.

Sim looked at me then. “Kvothe, I’ll need you on the Wind.”

I blinked at him through the haze of pain and exhaustion. “I—Sim, I don’t know if I can.” My hands trembled slightly, and my breath caught just short of admitting the truth: that calling the Name of the Wind now, in my state, could do as much harm to me as it could to our enemies.

“You don’t have to stop it,” Sim said carefully, lowering his voice so only I could hear. “Just slow it down. A glancing blow. Give us time.”

Time. Everything we were doing came down to snatching at those fleeting, fragile moments that we might wring between their strikes. He wasn’t asking the world of me. He wasn’t asking for miracles. He just wanted me to try. There was something in his voice—something firm and unrelenting. It wasn’t desperation. It was belief.

I nodded once, pulling myself upright with a sharp intake of breath. “Alright. Do what you can down here.”

### * * *

“Wil,” Sim said, already moving toward the remaining guards. “Take three men. You’ll get the oil down. Focus on that first. Tip the cauldron directly over the courtyard when I give the order—no half measures, I don’t care if it spills on their shields.”

Wil saluted him with a sarcastic flourish but gathered the men just the same. “On it, Commander Sim.” His voice carried its usual wit, but in his stride there was purpose.

Sim turned to the guards remaining in the room. “You two—gather every bolt, every arrow. If it flies, we shoot it. Aim for the siege crew. No excuses. Not one of them leaves without an arrow in their gut. Understand?”

The men nodded, their stunned expressions reminding me that they weren’t used to taking orders from anyone who wasn’t screaming them half-deliriously or dragging bottles of ale between breaths. Sim wasn’t barking orders; he was giving them a lifeline.

Even King Roderick seemed struck dumb, watching Sim with an expression I couldn’t entirely place. There was pride there, but also something quieter. Something guiltier.

Sim held my gaze for a moment, the unspoken question resting between us: *Will it be enough?*

Neither of us said it, but we both knew the answer. It didn’t have to be enough. It just had to buy us time.

### * * *

The first stone launched.

I was ready. I pressed one hand to the cold stone of the wall, feeling its solidity beneath my fingers. It eased the unsteady churn of my mind as I reached for the Wind. 

It came to me slowly, like coaxing a shy animal into the open. My body was too battered, my focus too thin, to call it with the force I wanted. But Sim had been right—I didn’t need force. I needed precision. 

When I whispered the Name of the Wind, my voice was weaker than usual, but the world heard me all the same.

The air shifted outside the tower just before the stone struck. The massive projectile tilted, its trajectory skewing just enough to miss the central structure. It slammed into the outer parapet instead, scattering shards of stone like deadly debris. The impact rattled through the tower, enough to break my concentration and send me stumbling into the wall.

Sim ran to my side, steadying me. “You did it,” he said, his voice caught somewhere between disbelief and gratitude.

“I slowed it,” I croaked. “That’s all.”

“You bought us time.”

He ran back toward the defenders as Wil called down: “Oil’s ready!” From above, the sound of bubbling liquid hit my ears, and a moment later, the roar of flames filled the courtyard.

### * * *

Through the arrow slit, I watched as Fascino’s crew scrambled under the firestorm. The boiling oil had gummed up portions of the cranking mechanism, and one of the men operating the mangonel writhed in flames, clutching at his charred arm as he fell screaming to the ground. The siege weapon wouldn’t fire as quickly now.

But the engine itself wasn’t destroyed. Not yet.

Wil returned to the room, sweat misting his brow. “That’s their last smooth volley for a while,” he said. His voice softened slightly as he looked at me. “If you’re pulling your Naming stunts again, try not to kill yourself before we all die together.”

“They’re still firing,” Sim muttered, his expression darkening.

I stepped forward despite my vision swimming. “One more,” I said hoarsely, watching as the mangonel’s crew regrouped. They were cranking the mechanism again, though more slowly this time. My shoulder throbbed violently, but the part of me that had always sought defiance burned brighter than the pain. “I’ll get one more shot.”

I reached for the Wind again, mind trembling under the strain.

### * * *

Just before I could summon it again, Sim’s hand caught my arm. “No,” he said firmly. “They’ll keep coming, and you’ll burn out too quickly. We have to try something else.”

“What else is there?” I rasped, my breathing ragged.

“You gave us time,” Sim said. “It’s enough to organize one counterstrike before they regroup. Let me figure the rest out.”

I leaned back against the wall as Sim moved away, his voice calling new orders to the remaining defenders. I let my eyes drift partially closed, not resting but counting every heartbeat.

Outside, Fascino’s voice rang through the chaos, smooth and venomous. “Still standing, are you?” he called. “Your tower’s a corpse on its feet! Look around, and tell me—was this worth it?”

I didn’t answer him. What was the point of answering a man pretending to be above it all when his world burned just like mine?

Instead, I turned toward the others preparing for the next assault, blood seeping through the bandages on my shoulder, my voice soft and steady for Sim: “Whatever you need, I’ll still be here.”
