# CHAPTER 33.

## THE TOWER.


THE SMELL STRUCK first, sour ale soaked into wood, rancid grease spilled and left to linger, the close, heavy scent of unwashed bodies pressed too tight together. The garrison was a shattered remnant of itself. Sixteen guards slumped in a space built for twice their number, fingers curled loosely around bottles, eyes glazed by drink. Some regarded me blankly, faces slack, while others ignored me entirely, heads bowed and shoulders limp like scarecrows abandoned to a storm.  

This was no fortress. It was a hollow shell drowning in surrender.  

Roderick paced the center of the room, his voice sharp against the drunken murmurs. "Ready yourselves! Get moving, damn you! They’ll be at the gates any moment!" His commands stumbled uselessly against their indifference. The strength he tried to summon was fragile, a brittle mask pretending to be stone.  

My eyes met his then, and in that instant I understood. The panic behind his commands was not meant for his men alone. It was a refrain he spoke for himself, something to hold back the crushing weight of betrayal.  

“Kvothe!” Auri’s voice snapped me back. She hurried toward me, eyes wide with worry fixed upon the crimson stain blossoming slowly across my shoulder. “You’re hurt!”  

Glancing downward, I finally took measure of the crossbow bolt lodged beneath my clavicle. Four inches of blackened oak jutted out mockingly, shallow enough to let me stand yet deep enough to remind me how thin the line was between breathing and silence. Lucky, I thought, though the word felt bitter on my tongue. What kind of fool calls himself lucky with a shard of wood buried in his chest?  

“I’ll live,” I said, though every movement sent fire blooming beneath my skin.  

Sim paled visibly behind me, stepping closer to peer at the wound. “Looks pretty awful.”  

“I know what to do!” Auri announced suddenly. Her voice, always airy and light, now held a firmness I’d never heard before. She grasped my arm, guiding me firmly toward a nearby stool. Auri wanting to help was expected. But Auri taking charge felt like stepping into another world entirely.  

She was already tearing a strip from her sleeve. Her voice softened, patient yet firm as a mother’s command to a restless child. “You’ll sit right here. No moving around until I've set this straight.”  

I opened my mouth to protest but found linen pressed firmly between my teeth. “Bite down,” she instructed sharply. “A hedgehog with a bolt sticking out of him isn't fooling anyone.”  

I glared, but her quiet strength allowed no room for argument. She gestured quickly toward Sim, who hovered uncertainly. “Steady the bolt. Just behind the base, yes, good.” Then her eyes flashed toward Wil. “Break the shaft. Quick and clean.”  

Wil frowned deeply. “Quick I can do. Clean is the trick.”  

Auri offered no response, busying herself with quick, confident movements. Wil reached forward and snapped the bolt. The sound was sharp, like stone cracking in frost.  

Pain flared bright and blinding, scattering every thought into splinters. The world narrowed sharply to agony. I hardly felt Auri draw the bolt free, her small hands swift and merciless, each motion practiced and exact. Somewhere beyond the edges of pain, Sim choked back nausea, and Wil turned aside, murmuring dark curses.  

“You’re lucky,” Auri murmured finally, after tying the last strip snugly about my shoulder. Her voice had gentled again, soothing as a cool breeze after fever. “No bone, no veins. Only your pride damaged.”  

I blinked away the tears clouding my vision and looked clearly at her then. This was not the shy hermit I'd coaxed from shadowed corners. This was someone else entirely, steady, certain, capable. Had she trained in the Medica? No, surely I would have known.  

Nearby, Roderick watched her with an expression I could not easily name, a tangled blend of confusion, pride, and perhaps a shadow of guilt.  

“Did you learn that at the University?” the King asked cautiously.  

Auri’s hands paused, just for an instant, and she lifted her gaze calmly to his. “Of course,” she said softly.  

Roderick began to speak again but caught himself sharply. He turned away instead, jaw clenched tight as stone.

The tower groaned as I stumbled to the narrow arrow slits. A few men had risen, their faces pale beneath flickering lamplight. I peered outside and felt hope wither inside my chest.  

Fascino’s forces moved in rhythmic precision, scarlet banners streaming like tongues of flame. Tight ranks surged around the tower’s base, shield bearers pressed at the front. Their every step spoke a sharp hunger for battle. At their center, the massive timber ram loomed, a dark god surrounded by men with bowed heads, preparing their charge.  

I pressed a palm against cold stone, breathing through the ache in my shoulder. Beside me, Sim spoke softly, "We're trapped, aren't we?"  

I did not answer.  

"Lugosi will come," Roderick muttered behind me, his voice thin and distant. "He has to. Any hour now."  

"No one's coming," I said, my words heavier than I intended. "This is what we have."  

Wil swore quietly. Sim stayed silent, fingers brushing the stone window frame. I felt the turning of his thoughts like slow, grinding wheels.  

"What do we have left?" he asked, looking toward one of the sober guards.  

The guard shrugged. "Oil. Pitch. Some gear upstairs. No tunnels out. Just us. That's all."  

Sim glanced at me, eyes lingering on my wounded shoulder. "You can't lead like this," he said bluntly.  

"I'll manage," I replied, even as darkness threatened the edges of my vision.  

"Tehlu’s breath, you can barely stand. Let me help," Sim snapped, a rare edge in his usually gentle voice.  

I stepped back, leaning against the wall. My voice softened. "Alright."  

For a long while, I'd wondered why Sim had never stepped forward despite his quiet strength. Once he'd told me that his father, the Duke of Daloni, had tried to mold him into a leader. Tried and failed. Sim had no craving for power, no hunger for control. Kind hearts never grasped the reins. They shied away.  

But perhaps his father had been right to hope. Perhaps leadership did not always grow from ambition. Perhaps it grew from necessity.  

Sim squared his shoulders, mouth tightening into a resolute line. "Wil, bring down the oil. Start with the murderholes." He turned to the guards, voice clear enough to pierce their fog. "You two, gather anything sharp. Swords, arrows, chair legs if you must. Bring everything here."  

To my surprise, they obeyed. Sim’s voice now carried weight.  

Outside, Fascino began his ultimatum, his smooth words rising like poison on the breeze. "Surrender the King and the rest of you leave alive. Refuse me and you'll see your own bellies spilled before the sun sets."  

The guards shifted uneasily. Before doubt could set its roots, Sim lifted his voice. "Don't believe him." He stepped further into the lamplight, calm and steady. "Look outside. Look at the street. Tell me how many brothers and sisters Fascino has left alive. Go on. Count them."  

A heavy silence filled the room. Sim let it linger.  

"That's what I thought," he said. "He doesn't want mercy. He wants your fear. Don't give it to him."  

I'd never seen him like this, standing not as a friend but as a leader. For the first time, beneath the darkening shadow of battle, the room steadied itself.  

### * * *

The ram came first.  

From the tower, I watched Fascino’s soldiers surge forward. Some bore shields, others shouldered the massive timber, heavy as a felled tree. They swarmed into place. Sim barked orders, his voice steady, a note of certainty new to his tongue yet fitting all the same.  

Roderick’s voice rang out behind us. “For Vintas! Hold the fort, men!”  

Even amid the uproar, I heard how his cry rang false. There was no time to dwell on it. The ram reached the bridge. Sim’s command snapped through the air. “Loose!”  

A volley of arrows met the front ranks, striking where the shields were thin. Soldiers tumbled, their bodies dragging the ram askew. Yet others stepped forward to fill the gaps, shield bearers pressing onward, and the gate trembled beneath the weight of the blows.  

The tower groaned, sending a shiver of dust down from the old stones. Each strike found its way into my bones. Sim shouted again. “Ready the cauldron!” He rushed to help the others, together heaving the vat of boiling oil above the gate.  

“Now!” The cauldron tipped. Fire poured down, cruel and bright. The ram crew screamed. Bottles of dreg crashed after, igniting wherever they struck. The courtyard flared with sudden light, and Fascino’s soldiers scattered like startled insects beneath a sudden torch.  

For a breath, hope lived. Then, on the far side of the field, I saw the mangonel rise.
