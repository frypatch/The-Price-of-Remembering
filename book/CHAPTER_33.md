# CHAPTER 33.

## THE TOWER.


SOUR ALE HAD SOAKED so deep into the floorboards that the wood itself seemed drunk. Rancid lamp oil coated the walls, thick and yellow. Bottles lay where they’d fallen, and swords leaned against walls like tired men. I knew this particular neglect. It was the same absence that fills a hearth when the last ember dies and no one reaches for the kindling.  

Sixteen guards filled this room built for forty. Some sat with bottles cradled like infants against their chests. Others stared at nothing with the doomed blindness that comes from years of boredom. They were forgotten men in a forgotten tower, remembered only when the King needed blood.  

“Ready yourselves!” Roderick’s voice cracked against their indifference like waves against stone. “Get moving! They’ll be at the gates any moment!”  

But the words failed, as they always do when a man tries to command loyalty he never thought to earn. I watched the King pace the center of the room, his movements frantic and floundering, each gesture grasping at authority these men had no reason to grant. Behind his commands lay something else. Something like fear trying to sound like power, speaking to keep the silence at bay.  

“Oh.” Auri’s voice came soft from across the room. She crossed to me in three quick steps, her eyes fixed on my shoulder with an intensity I had never seen in her before. “You’ve brought me a quill!”  

I looked down at the crossbow bolt jutting from beneath my clavicle. Four inches of blackened oak, splintered where it had kissed stone before finding me. “I did,” I said, my voice tight with pain. “Tricked a porcupine out of it. Though I’m afraid I’ve stained it red.”  

“That happens sometimes,” Auri said, her whimsy fading as she took my arm with surprising firmness. “Sit here. We’ll make it proper again.”  

Sim moved closer, studying the wound properly for the first time since the running stopped. His face went white. “Merciful Tehlu. That looks awful.”  

Auri paid him no mind. She tore a strip from her sleeve with unexpected efficiency and set it aside. Her fingers traced the splintered shaft, testing its stability. She looked up at me, her eyes worried. “It kissed the stone too hard,” she whispered. “Broke itself trying. Won’t come out whole.”  

I understood. “We need to break it.”  

She nodded and pressed the cloth between my teeth, her touch gentle as always. “This will help,” she said softly.  

I turned to Sim and Wil. “Sim, hold the bolt steady. Wil, when I nod, snap it quick and clean.”  

“Quick I can manage,” Wil said. “Clean is another matter.”  

Wil snapped the bolt. Pain came white and sharp, scattering thought into fragments. I felt Auri draw the broken shaft free with one smooth motion. Felt her press cloth against the wound with exactly the right amount of pressure.  

When the white faded from my vision, she was bent close, examining what the bolt had left behind. Her fingers worked with gentle precision, but I felt the scrape of something against my raw flesh. She made a soft sound, troubled. Her fingertips came away gritty.  

“Stone dust,” I said, understanding. “From the ricochet.”  

She nodded, still focused entirely on the wound. “Bits that don’t belong,” she whispered. “They want to stay but mustn’t. They’ll turn things wrong.”  

“How bad?” Sim asked, his voice tight.  

I looked down at Auri’s careful work. “Bad enough.”  

Each bit of debris she drew free brought a small white star of pain. Gasps broke from me, unbidden, but Auri never wavered. I had never seen such steadiness in her hands, had never witnessed such quiet certainty. Had she studied at the Medica? No. I would have known. Wouldn’t I?  

When she finished, she tied the last bandage with a knot that would hold but not bind. She looked up at me with those wide eyes. “The red’s stopped running away now,” she said softly.  

As Roderick watched her, something complicated moved across his face. Pride and guilt twisted together, wound tight with recognition and regret.  

“Did you learn that at the University?” he asked. His voice carried the weight of knowing the answer.  

Auri’s eyes lifted to his. Just for a breath. Just long enough for him to see what lived there before she looked away. “Of course,” she said softly.  

The King opened his mouth, closed it, turned away. His jaw worked as if chewing words too bitter to swallow.

The tower groaned as I stumbled to the narrow arrow slits. A few men had risen, their faces pale beneath flickering lamplight. I peered outside and felt hope wither inside my chest.  

Fascino’s forces moved in rhythmic precision, scarlet banners streaming like tongues of flame. Tight ranks surged around the tower’s base, shield bearers pressed at the front. Their every step spoke a sharp hunger for battle. At their center, the massive timber ram loomed, a dark god surrounded by men with bowed heads, preparing their charge.  

I pressed a palm against cold stone, breathing through the ache in my shoulder. Beside me, Sim spoke softly, “We’re trapped, aren’t we?”  

I did not answer.  

“Lugosi will come,” Roderick muttered behind me, his voice thin and distant. “He has to. Any hour now.”  

“No one’s coming,” I said, my words heavier than I intended. “This is what we have.”  

Wil swore quietly. Sim stayed silent, fingers brushing the stone window frame. I felt the turning of his thoughts like slow, grinding wheels.  

“What do we have left?” he asked, looking toward one of the sober guards.  

The guard shrugged. “Oil. Pitch. Some gear upstairs. No tunnels out. Just us. That’s all.”  

Sim glanced at me, eyes lingering on my wounded shoulder. “You can’t lead like this,” he said bluntly.  

“I’ll manage,” I replied, even as darkness threatened the edges of my vision.  

“Tehlu’s breath, you can barely stand. Let me help,” Sim snapped, a rare edge in his usually gentle voice.  

I stepped back, leaning against the wall. My voice softened. “Alright.”  

For a long while, I’d wondered why Sim had never stepped forward despite his quiet strength. Once he’d told me that his father, the Duke of Daloni, had tried to mold him into a leader. Tried and failed. Sim had no craving for power, no hunger for control. Kind hearts never grasped the reins. They shied away.  

But perhaps his father had been right to hope. Perhaps leadership did not always grow from ambition. Perhaps it grew from necessity.  

Sim squared his shoulders, mouth tightening into a resolute line. “Wil, bring down the oil. Start with the murderholes.” He turned to the guards, voice clear enough to pierce their fog. “You two, gather anything sharp. Swords, arrows, chair legs if you must. Bring everything here.”  

To my surprise, they obeyed. Sim’s voice now carried weight.  

Outside, Fascino began his ultimatum, his smooth words rising like poison on the breeze. “Surrender the King and the rest of you leave alive. Refuse me and you’ll see your own bellies spilled before the sun sets.”  

The guards shifted uneasily. Before doubt could set its roots, Sim lifted his voice. “Don’t believe him.” He stepped further into the lamplight, calm and steady. “Look outside. Look at the street. Tell me how many brothers and sisters Fascino has left alive. Go on. Count them.”  

A heavy silence filled the room. Sim let it linger.  

“That’s what I thought,” he said. “He doesn’t want mercy. He wants your fear. Don’t give it to him.”  

I’d never seen him like this, standing not as a friend but as a leader. For the first time, beneath the darkening shadow of battle, the room steadied itself.  

### * * *

The ram came first.  

From the tower, I watched Fascino’s soldiers surge forward. Some bore shields, others shouldered the massive timber, heavy as a felled tree. They swarmed into place. Sim barked orders, his voice steady, a note of certainty new to his tongue yet fitting all the same.  

Roderick’s voice rang out behind us. “For Vintas! Hold the fort, men!”  

Even amid the uproar, I heard how his cry rang false. There was no time to dwell on it. The ram reached the bridge. Sim’s command snapped through the air. “Loose!”  

A volley of arrows met the front ranks, striking where the shields were thin. Soldiers tumbled, their bodies dragging the ram askew. Yet others stepped forward to fill the gaps, shield bearers pressing onward, and the gate trembled beneath the weight of the blows.  

The tower groaned, sending a shiver of dust down from the old stones. Each strike found its way into my bones. Sim shouted again. “Ready the cauldron!” He rushed to help the others, together heaving the vat of boiling oil above the gate.  

“Now!” The cauldron tipped. Fire poured down, cruel and bright. The ram crew screamed. Bottles of dreg crashed after, igniting wherever they struck. The courtyard flared with sudden light, and Fascino’s soldiers scattered like startled insects beneath a sudden torch.  

For a breath, hope lived. Then, on the far side of the field, I saw the mangonel rise.
