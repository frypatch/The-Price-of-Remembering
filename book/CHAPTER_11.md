# CHAPTER 11.

## THE PRICE WE PAY.


I reached down to help Devi. She took my hand, her grip firm. She scrambled up, graceless but determined, and for a moment we sat together on the wall, looking down into the courtyard. Moonlight filtered through the apple tree’s branches, the same tree I’d climbed down countless times to visit Auri. The flagstones were thick with moss, just as they’d always been. But tonight I was seeing it with different eyes.  

“It’s smaller than I thought,” she said.  

We lowered ourselves down. Our boots crunched on dead leaves. The sound was impossibly loud in the stillness. I held my breath, waiting for a shout, a light, some sign that we’d been heard. Nothing. No one. We were alone.  

Devi unpacked her satchel. Vials of acid compound, stoppered and ready. Brushes. Cloths soaked in neutralizing solution. A small trowel.  

“Here,” I said, pointing to a section of flagstone near the wall’s center. “This was where its ceiling should be.”  

Devi knelt and pressed her palm against the stone. “The acid works,” she said, “but it’s not quick. We’ll need to be patient.”  

“How patient?”  

“Spans, not days.” She unstoppered one of the vials. A faint acrid smell rose. “But we’ll get through.”  

She applied a brushstroke of acid to the stone. It hissed. Vapor rose.  

### * * *  

The nights blurred together after that.  

We developed a rhythm. Every night we scaled the wall. Devi would apply the acid while I prepared the neutralizing cloths and disposed of the powdered stone we scraped away. We worked in silence, speaking only when necessary.  

The stone was harder than we’d expected. Old and dense. Well-made. Some nights the depression deepened by a finger’s width. Other nights the acid accomplished nothing and we left before dawn with little to show but aching knees and chemical burns on our fingertips.  

But we kept at it. Night after night.  

The days blurred. I attended classes, worked in the Fishery, acted as if I had nothing to hide. But my mind was always in the courtyard, calculating how much deeper we’d gone, how much further we had to go. I ate without tasting. I slept in fragments, never deeply, always listening for bells.  

On the ninth night, we almost got caught.  

Devi was brushing acid into the depression, now nearly a foot deep, when footsteps sounded on the second floor walkway. We froze. A drop of acid hung trembling at the tip of her brush.  

The footsteps were slow, pausing once at a window. My heart stopped. They continued on, fading into the distance.  

Neither of us moved.  

Then Devi let out a breath, almost a laugh, her shoulders dropping.  

“That was closer than I’d like.” Her voice was barely a whisper.  

I smiled at the absurdity of it. Two people crouched in an abandoned courtyard, dissolving stone in the middle of the night, freezing at the sound of footsteps. We were criminals and fools.  

“We should be more careful,” I said.  

“We should stop entirely,” she replied. But she was smiling as she turned back to her work.  

### * * *  

During those hours, I began to know her.  

Not the Devi who bargained and smiled and kept her secrets close. Not Demon Devi, the gaelet who dealt in blood and debts. The other one. The one who could let her guard down.  

One night, as she worked, she talked about her expulsion. Not the official story, conduct unbecoming or dangerous experimentation, but the truth beneath it.  

“I was better than them,” she said. “Better than Elxa Dal, even. They knew it. The Masters. They could see what I was becoming, and it frightened them.”  

“That’s why they expelled you? Because you were too good?”  

“Because I was too good and too hungry and too unwilling to pretend otherwise.” She scraped away a layer of softened stone with more force than necessary. “The University is built on hierarchies, Kvothe. Master and student. Teacher and taught. Male and female. They couldn’t tolerate someone who threatened to climb faster than they allowed. Especially not a young woman.”  

I thought of my own struggles with the Masters. The way Hemme looked at me. The careful dance of deference and defiance I performed every day just to maintain my place.  

“So you left,” I said.  

“I was thrown out.” Her voice hardened. “There’s a difference. They took everything from me. My rank, my access, my future. They reduced me to a gaelet operating out of a room above a butcher’s shop.” She turned to look at me. “I’m not just trying to get into the Archives, Kvothe. I’m taking back what they stole.”  

I understood that hunger. The need to reclaim something lost. For her it was status, potential, the life she should have had. For me it was answers. Justice. The truth about what had happened to my family.  

“What about you?” she asked. “Why does the door matter so much?”  

I hesitated. I had never told anyone the full truth. Not Sim, not Wil, not even Denna. The words were too heavy, too dangerous.  

But with stone dust on my hands and acid-smell in my lungs, I spoke anyway.  

“The Chandrian,” I said quietly. “They killed my family. My whole troupe. I was eleven years old.”  

Devi went still. “The Chandrian are a myth.”  

“They’re not.” I kept my eyes on the stone, unable to look at her. “I saw them. Haliax, their leader. Cinder, the one who killed my father.” I stopped, swallowed. “They’re real, and they’re out there, and no one will believe me because the stories make them into bogeymen for children.”  

“And you think the answers are behind that door?”  

“I think someone has been systematically removing information about them from the Archives. Every book I find, every reference I chase, leads to empty shelves and missing pages. But whoever built that room, whoever sealed it away, they kept records. They have to have.”  

Devi looked at me. Something passed between us. I couldn’t have named it at the time. But I understand it now.
