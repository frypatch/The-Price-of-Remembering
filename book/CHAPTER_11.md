# CHAPTER 11

## THE PRICE WE PAY

I WOKE TO the groan of a chair, soft and uneasy, like an argument left unresolved. My room swam around me as I blinked myself into awareness. Devi sat a few feet away, hunched forward, her elbows balanced on her knees. Shadows pooled under her eyes, and her sharp edges seemed dulled, as if her usual confidence had been shaken loose and left somewhere I couldn’t see.  

“Devi,” I croaked, my voice brittle, scraping against the dryness in my throat. The sound startled me, jagged and unfamiliar, like it belonged to someone else entirely. “What… what are you doing here?”  

She didn’t answer right away. Her hands were busy weaving and unweaving her hair like restless spiders threading and unthreading their web. The motion wasn’t precise, not the efficient and deliberate movements I expected from Devi. It was unsure. Nervous. When she finally looked at me, her eyes glinted with something I wasn’t used to seeing in them. Regret.  

“Kvothe,” she began. Just my name, quiet and weighty as a stone dropped into still water. Then, softer, “I’m sorry.”  

The words hung in the air between us, fragile and unfamiliar. Devi didn’t apologize. She negotiated. She angled. She teased, and she pried, but she never apologized. Hearing it now unsettled me more than anger would have.  

“S-sorry?” I managed, leaning on my elbows to push myself upright. The room tilted as I moved, and it took everything I had not to collapse back onto the bed.  

She pressed her lips tight. I could see her deciding, weighing how much to say and how to say it. Finally, she breathed sharp and fast through her nose. “The potion.” She spoke the words carefully, like they might snap in her teeth. “I miscalculated the nahirout dosage.”  

The air stilled, and I felt my chest tighten. “Miscalculated,” I repeated, though my mind had already raced ahead, pulling threads, tying knots.  

Devi nodded once, her hands still tugging at loose strands of her hair. “I tested a smaller dose on myself after hearing your… report,” she continued. “I thought maybe it was weak. The balance between the sedative and the stimulant was wrong, so I adjusted the formula.” She hesitated, her voice momentarily caught on the next words. “Turns out, it wasn’t weak at all. It was too strong.”  

My stomach tightened, but I forced myself to ask. “What happened?”  

“I slept,” she said, her tone flat, as if she could iron out the anxiety in her chest by keeping her words smooth. “For an hour. Maybe two. Then I woke up. Wide awake, Kvothe. Three days of it. My thoughts—” She stopped, her hands stilled in her lap, knotting themselves together instead. “My thoughts were like wildfire. They moved too fast. My body…” She shook her head. “It felt like a bowstring drawn too tight.”  

The nausea rose suddenly and violently, crashing over me like a wave. Three days. A smaller dose. What had I done?  

My hands moved on instinct. I rolled to the edge of the bed and stumbled toward the basin near the window. My legs felt like half-filled waterskins, awkward and unwieldy under me. I fell to my knees, heaving into the basin, the sour burn of bile tearing at my throat.  

Behind me, Devi stayed still, the way you stand too near a fire but don’t dare touch it or move away. She didn’t speak, didn’t try to help. But she didn’t leave, either.  

When my stomach was empty, I lay against the cool stone wall, breathing heavily. I reached for the calm I’d spent years cultivating—the deliberate focus—a skill honed as much in fireside survival as in sympathy. It came sluggishly, but it came all the same.  

“Devi,” I said, my voice low and cracked. I didn’t look at her, but I felt her stiffen slightly. “I’ve figured it out.” I forced my trembling hand to mirror steadiness. “A way to reach the Four-Plate Door without ever opening it.”  

She hesitated only a moment before rising from her chair. The scrape of wood on the floor made my teeth ache. She didn’t reply as she stepped toward the door. Then, just as it swung open, she glanced back, a mixture of hope and caution written in her raised brow. “Don’t tease me, Kvothe,” she said with her usual sharpness, but her voice softened as she disappeared down the stairwell.

Hours passed, or maybe only minutes. Time bent in strange ways when my thoughts spiraled like this. Lorren’s face lingered at the edges of my mind: his measured steps, his steady hand pouring water from that jug, the bowstring too tight, the sleep not coming.  

Finally, I forced myself out of my room and into Imre. The air felt sharp against my skin, crisp as paper freshly creased. Buildings rose like sentinels around me, their shadows cool against the warm stones of the streets. I walked without looking at anyone, keeping my head down, my thoughts louder than the bustle around me.  

It wasn’t long before I found Sim and Wilem at their usual spot. The chairs they sat in were old, wooden things with more creak than structure left in them, clustered in a lazy circle outside one of the quieter corners of the Eolian. There was something grounding about finding them there as though the universe had conspired to keep one place steady.  

“Look who finally crawled out of whatever deep, dark hole he found,” Sim said, grinning as he clapped a hand on my shoulder.  

“I thought you’d burned the Archives to the ground and left town,” Wil said, his grin softer but no less warm.  

“Missed you too,” I replied with a thin smile that landed somewhere between forced and genuine.  

Their laughter came like water over rocks, smoothing what had been rough for days. But something gnawed at the back of my mind: the silence. No one mentioned Lorren or spoke of strange outbursts in the Archives. No rumors had reached their ears of sleepless nights haunting the Master Archivist. That silence carried weight. It pressed on me, heavy and unwelcome.  

Still, I drank in their company. For a short while, I let myself laugh. It wasn’t easy, and it wasn’t full, but it was something.  

### * * *

Devi’s door loomed before me again, familiar now in its strange way. This time, when she answered, her grin was firmly in place. The softness from earlier had burned away.  

“Back already?” she said, her brow arching. Even before I spoke, I could see she knew why I had come.  

I wasted no time. “I’ve figured it out,” I said, the words spilling out almost before I could stop them.  

Her grin sharpened, her posture shifting. She angled forward, her eyes narrowing like a hawk locking onto prey. “What exactly has that clever little mind of yours figured out, Kvothe?”  

I took a long breath. My heartbeat picked up again. “How to reach past the Four-Plated Door.”  

Her eyes sharpened immediately. Her posture changed, leaning forward like a hawk locking onto prey. “You’re serious.”  

“Serious as anything,” I said. But my voice held its own hesitation. My work wasn’t done. A storm gathered inside me, flickering with shame and ambition in equal measure. But for now, I had a foothold. And I wasn’t done climbing yet.
