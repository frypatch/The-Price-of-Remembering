# CHAPTER 29.

## LOCKLESS.


THE ROAD SOUTH TO Renere stretched long and winding ahead of us. Dust rose in thin plumes behind our horses as we rode in silence. Denna remained focused on the Lockless box, her lips forming the occasional fragment of a word as her fingers traced its carved patterns. Meanwhile, my mind churned with a puzzle of its own.  

The Amyr. For years I pinned all my hopes on them, imagining them as avenging shadows, scholars and warriors who would stand beside me and help unravel the mystery of my family’s deaths. Instead, I found nothing but a shadow of the legend I had expected. The order was content to endure rather than act, to hide rather than strike. If the Chandrian were ever to be confronted, it seemed that task would fall to me alone.  

Lost in thought, I barely registered Denna’s sudden cry.  

“I’ve got it!” she exclaimed, her voice cutting through the quiet air like a plucked harp string.  

Startled, I nearly slipped from my saddle. “The box?” I asked as I hurried to dismount and join her on the ground.  

“I think I’ve deciphered part of it,” she said, her eyes bright with excitement. We quickly tethered the horses beneath a nearby tree, and Denna sat cross-legged on the grass with the box balanced delicately in her lap.  

“Look here,” she began softly, her fingertips brushing over a symbol carved in the top left corner of the lid. “This section suggests something about dual ownership.” She moved her finger to another cluster of markings. “And here it mentions a key.” Her brow creased as she studied the next line. “But this part is strange. It speaks of a ‘lasting male essence.’”  

“Male essence?” I echoed, raising an eyebrow.  

“I did say it was strange,” she replied with a soft laugh. Her smile faded as her expression grew thoughtful and her voice fell quiet. “Some of these words I still can’t make out. I keep debating whether one is ‘cage’ or ‘coop’. But the last part is clear,” she said, meeting my eyes. She looked back down at the box and murmured, “By their blood, the ring remains closed.”  

“The ring?” I asked.  

Denna nodded, a frown tugging at her mouth. “Exactly. I was hoping you might know what it means.” Her voice trailed off, leaving the unspoken question hanging in the air.  

“What about this part?” I asked, attempting to point her attention at another series of flowing patterns etched near the base of the box.  

Denna hesitated. Then she took my hand, guiding my fingers over the final line of carvings as if to share the weight of their meaning. “‘Never free,’” she whispered. “‘For only the something of death lies beyond.’”  

The carved words hung between us in the still afternoon. Neither of us spoke for a long moment, and a soft wind stirred the leaves overhead.  

“Well, that sounds cheerful,” I said, trying to muster a smile.  

Denna’s lips quirked in return, but worry still creased her brow. “That’s all I can make of it for now,” she said quietly, placing the box gently on the ground. “My grandmother was the real expert at this sort of thing. If only she were still alive.” She fell silent and looked away, regret flickering in her eyes.  

“You’ve done more than enough,” I said, resting a hand on her shoulder. “Only a rare few could have even this much.”  

“You flatter me too much,” Denna said, her gaze meeting mine for an instant before a lighter laugh slipped out. “Where in the Four Corners did you ever get ‘Dance’ from? That wasn’t even close.”  

I shrugged to mask my anxiety. “Like I said, I am still learning. Or I was. With Master Lorren’s unexpected passing, it seems my studies are at their end.” We rose and made our way to the horses. As I began to untether the reins, I glanced at her. “What do you think it means?”  

Denna paused, her earlier levity fading into unease. “Honestly? I’m not sure I want to find out what’s inside.”  

### * * *

As twilight fell, the final rays of the sun painted the horizon in hues of fire and ash. Denna and I turned off the main road and made our camp beside a still pond where a toppled greystone jutted from the shallows like the finger of some forgotten monument.  

We unpacked with deliberate leisure, laying out a simple feast we had been saving for a lingering dusk like this one. There was thick bread, potatoes baked in the coals and still warm, figs we’d plucked fresh along the way, and butter so rich and firm it might as well have been cheese. By any simple measure it was already a feast. Even so, I had one more surprise tucked away.  

“I’ve been saving this for just the right occasion,” I said as I pulled a bottle of strawberry wine from my travel sack.  

Denna burst into laughter, falling back onto the grass. “You’ve been hauling that all this time?” she said, wiping a tear from her eye.  

“What’s wrong with strawberry wine?” I asked, feigning offense.  

“Nothing,” she said with a delighted grin. “It’s just funny you should say that.” With a playful flourish, she reached into her satchel and brought out a bottle of amber mead as her own offering.  

I took the bottle gently from her hands and turned it to admire the elegant wax seal. “Metheglin!” I exclaimed. “The mead of kings. Well, if this isn’t the finest coincidence.”  

Denna smiled, a flush warming her cheeks. “I picked it up in Anilin. I almost brought it out back in Renere, but I figured you needed all your wits about you for the duel.”  

“You, Denna,” I said, sweeping into a dramatic bow, “are truly extraordinary.”  

“And you,” she replied, “are far too easily impressed.”  

The mead’s gentle fire blossomed in my chest, softening the hard edges of my thoughts. Stars kindled above, and we talked in low, easy voices. At first our conversation was light and unburdened. But as the night deepened and time itself seemed to slow and soften around us, our words grew deeper, and even our silences grew warm and companionable.  

### * * *

"The Vesumbri Islands," I said. My voice, loosened by drink, carried a hint of song. "They say a volcano god still gathers worship there. I have always wanted to see those islands with my own eyes."  

Denna gave a low laugh, swirling the last of her mead in its bottle. "Exotic." She flashed me a teasing smile. "I've never ventured that far myself. Unfinished business keeps me close to home these days."  

The lightness left her voice on those last words, and her gaze fell to the ground. I watched her quietly, uncertain whether I should break the hush growing between us.  

At last, she spoke again, her tone soft with uncertainty. "That remedy you gave me did help for a while. But my breathing has grown worse again. It hurts more than it used to."  

"Denna," I began softly, but the rest of my words died unspoken.  

She drew a shaky breath and continued, "I saw a physician in Atur. He was University-trained." Denna hesitated, then went on, "He called it phthisis. Scarring of the lungs that will only grow worse over time." She paused, and the silence hung heavy. She could not bring herself to say the rest.  

"No." I leaned forward, my voice suddenly fierce. "Come back to the University with me. Master Arwyl is the finest healer alive. If anyone can help you, he can."  

Denna placed her hand against my cheek. "You're kind, Kvothe. Truly." I could hear the sorrow in her voice as she began to protest.  

I cut her off before she could finish. "No," I said, more forcefully than I intended. "I don't care about your patron. Forget him. Come with me. Please."  

For a long moment she simply looked at me, lips parted as if to shape words that did not come. Then she lowered her eyes and gave the faintest nod. "For you, Kvothe," she whispered. "I will."  

The night deepened around us, wrapping us in quiet darkness and pressing us close. We lay side by side on the soft grass. Denna gazed up at the scattered stars overhead, her voice as soft as a sigh. "I thought you would kiss me that night in Roent's caravan," she said.  

“Would you have wanted me to?” I asked, my voice unexpectedly nervous.  

Denna tilted her head toward me, her meaning clear before she even spoke. “Why not try and find out?”  

"Would you have wanted me to?" I asked. I was surprised to hear an unsteady tremor in my own voice.  

Denna turned her head toward me, her answer already shining in her dark eyes. "Why not try and find out?"  

I leaned in until the space between us disappeared. When our lips met, the rest of the world fell away. It was neither Felurian's careful art nor any practiced technique. It was something messier, simpler, and far more honest. It was Denna.  

I won’t share more than that. The rest is mine alone.  

Afterward, we lay tangled together beneath the open sky. She was perfect, at least to me. When she noticed me staring as I struggled to catch my breath, a mischievous smile curled at the corner of her mouth.  

"What's so funny?" I asked, giving her a gentle poke in the side.  

Denna rolled onto her back with a quiet giggle. "You just reminded me of a story I heard once," she said. "They call it ‘The Dulator’."  

"I can't say I'm familiar with that one," I admitted, brushing a strand of hair away from her face.  

She poked me back playfully. "Ah, the Stealer of Hearts," she replied. "I'll tell it to you sometime." Her eyes glistened with a secret delight as she looked at me. "My Dulator."  

I chuckled softly. "I've been called worse." I pressed a tender kiss to her lips.  

"Hold me. Keep me warm, my beautiful thief," she murmured.  

And I did.
