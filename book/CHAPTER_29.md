# CHAPTER 29

## LOCKLESS  

THE ROAD SOUTH TO Renere stretched long and winding, dust rising in thin plumes behind our horses as we rode in silence. Denna was focused on the Lockless box, her lips forming occasional fragments of words as her fingers traced its carvings. Meanwhile, my mind churned with its own puzzle.  

The Amyr. For years, I had pinned my hopes on them, imagining them as avenging shadows—scholars and warriors who might stand alongside me, who might help me unravel the mystery of my family’s deaths. Instead, I’d found a hollow echo of legend, an order content to endure rather than act, to hide rather than strike. If the Chandrian were to be confronted, it would fall to me alone.  

Lost in thought, I barely registered Denna’s sudden cry.  

“I’ve got it!” she exclaimed, her voice cutting through the quiet like a plucked string.  

Startled, I nearly slipped from my saddle. “The box?” I asked, already dismounting to join her.  

“I think I’ve deciphered part of it,” she said, her eyes bright. We tethered the horses beneath a tree, and Denna sat cross-legged on the grass, the box balanced delicately in her lap.  

“Look here,” she began, pointing at the top left corner of the lid. Her fingers brushed the carved patterns. “This section references dual ownership. And this,” she added, gesturing to another part, “mentions a key—though it’s strange. Something about ‘lasting male essence.’”  

“Male essence?” I repeated, raising an eyebrow.  

“I said it was strange,” she replied, laughing softly. Then her expression turned thoughtful, her voice quiet as she continued. “Here, several words are unclear. I keep circling between ‘cage’ and ‘coop,’ but the last part feels certain: ‘By their blood, the ring remains closed.’”  

“The ring?” I asked.  

She nodded, frowning. “Exactly. I was hoping you’d know what it means, but…”  

“What about this part?” I asked, gesturing toward more flowing patterns etched near the base.  

Denna hesitated, then took my hand, guiding my fingers over the carvings as if sharing the weight of their meaning. “‘Never free,’” she murmured. “‘For only the something of death lies beyond.’”  

The words hung in the quiet air between us. Neither of us spoke for a moment, the wind stirring the leaves above.  

“Well, that sounds cheerful,” I said, forcing a smile.  

Denna’s lips quirked, but the worry in her eyes lingered. “That’s all I can make of it for now,” she said, setting the box gently on the ground. “My grandmother was the real expert at this sort of thing. If she were still alive—” She stopped short, glancing away.  

“You’ve done more than enough,” I said gently, resting a hand on her shoulder. “Most people wouldn’t have gotten this far.”  

“You flatter me too much,” Denna said, meeting my eyes for a moment before laughing again, lighter this time. “Where in the Four Corners did you ever get ‘Dance’ from? That wasn’t even close.”  

“What do you think it means?” I asked as we stood to untether the horses.  

Denna paused, her expression suddenly serious. “Honestly? I’m not sure I want to find out what’s inside.”  

### * * *

As twilight fell, the sun’s last light painted the horizon in fire and ash. Denna and I stopped to make camp by a pond off the main road, where a toppled greystone jutted into the water’s edge like the finger of some forgotten monument.  

We unpacked with deliberate leisure, setting out provisions we had saved for this sort of lingering dusk. Thick bread, baked potatoes still warm from coals, figs plucked fresh along the road, and butter thick enough to be considered cheese. It was a feast by any simple measure, but I had one more surprise left.  

“I’ve been saving this for just the right occasion,” I said, drawing a bottle of strawberry wine from my travel sack.  

Denna burst into laughter, falling back onto the grass. “You’ve been hauling that all this time?” she said, wiping a tear from her eye.  

“What’s wrong with strawberry wine?” I asked, my voice mock-offended.  

“Nothing,” she replied, grinning broadly. “It’s just funny you should say that.” She reached into her satchel, producing her own surprise: a bottle of amber mead.  

I took it from her hands, turning it over to examine the elegant label. “Metheglin!” I exclaimed. “The mead of kings. Well, if this isn’t the finest coincidence.”  

Denna smiled, a flush warming her cheeks. “I picked it up in Anilin. I almost brought it out back in Renere, but I figured you needed all your wits about you for the duel.”  

“You, Denna,” I said, offering her a dramatic bow, “are truly extraordinary.”  

“And you,” she replied, raising her bottle, “are too easily impressed.”  

The mead had a golden warmth that spread through my chest in increments, smoothing the sharper edges of my thoughts. As the stars emerged above us, we began to talk—easily at first, then deeper as time softened our words.  

### * * *  

“The Vesumbri Islands,” I said, my voice lilting slightly with drink. “I heard stories about a volcano god they still worship. I’ve always wanted to see them.”  

“Exotic,” Denna teased, swirling the last of her mead in its bottle. “I’ve yet to make it out that far myself. Unfinished business keeps me close these days.”  

Her tone shifted on those last words, her gaze turning downward. I watched her silently, unsure of whether to break the stillness.  

Finally, she spoke again, softer now. “That remedy you gave me helped for a time, but my breathing—it’s worse again. It hurts more than it used to.”  

“Denna,” I began, the weight of her words stealing the air from my chest.  

“I saw a physician in Atur,” she cut in. “University-trained. He called it phthisis. Chronic scarring of the lungs. He said, eventually…” Her voice faltered. “Eventually…”  

“No,” I said firmly, sitting forward. “Come back to the University with me. Master Arwyl—he’s the finest healer alive. If anyone can help you…”  

“Kvothe,” Denna said, placing her hand on my cheek. “It’s kind of you, but—”  

“No,” I interrupted. “I don’t care about your patron. Forget him. Come with me. Please.”  

Her lips parted, searching for something unsaid. Then, at last, she nodded softly. “For you, Kvothe. I will.”  

### * * *

The night deepened, pressing us together in its quiet. Lying on the grass, Denna gazed into the stars above, her voice faint as a whisper. “I thought you’d kiss me that night in Roent’s caravan,” she said.  

“Would you have wanted me to?” I asked, my voice unexpectedly nervous.  

Denna tilted her head toward me, her meaning clear before she even spoke. “Why not try and find out?”  

I leaned closer, closing the space between us. When our lips met, the world fell away. It was not Felurian’s careful art, nor some practiced kiss of technique. It was something messier, simpler, and far more honest. Denna.  

I won’t share more than that. The rest is mine alone.  

Afterward, we laid together beneath the sky. Naked, perfect, at least to me. Catching me staring as I caught my breath, she smiled at me mischievously. 

“What's so funny?” l asked, prodding her gently with a finger. 

Denna rolled away, giggling, “You reminded me of a story I heard once. The Dulator.” 

“Can't say I'm familiar with that one,” I said. 

“Ah, the Stealer of Hearts. I'll tell it to you sometime,” she said, poking me back. “My Dulator,” Denna said, her eyes glistening. 

“I've been called worse,” I said, planting a kiss upon her lips. 

“Hold me. Keep me warm, my beautiful thief.” 

And I did.
