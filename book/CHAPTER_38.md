# CHAPTER 38.

## THE WOLF AND THE OWL.


THE STREETS OF Renere twisted and turned, leading me deeper into the city. I walked carefully now, favoring my left side where the rough gut stitches pulled, sending sharp reminders of yesterday’s violence through my ribs. The compass needle had been dancing in my palm for what felt like hours, its frantic motion my only guide through these unfamiliar alleys. When it suddenly stilled, my pulse quickened. The needle pointed steady as a finger of accusation toward another narrow alley.  

At the end of the alley, and through the gaps in the boarded windows, I saw her. Denna sat with her shoulders drawn in, making herself small the way rabbits do when hawks circle overhead. The man standing over her was tall and white-haired. His back was to me, but I knew the language of his body. I had learned it in Tarbean’s alleys, where grown men would corner children with that same predatory lean, that same casual ownership of space that promised violence if you didn’t give them what they wanted. His voice came muffled through the walls, but the melody of it was clear enough. Anger. Command. And the promise of worse to come.  

Instead of entering immediately, I circled to a side door and found it unlocked. Slipping inside, I stayed low and silent, creeping toward the sound of their argument. Only fragments of the conversation reached me at first.  

“This is how you repay me?” The man’s voice carried cold authority, its weight pricking at the edges of some vague memory. “After everything I’ve done for you, you lie to me?”  

“I brought what you asked for,” Denna replied, her voice trembling but steady. “Why do you need him so badly? Why does it have to be Kvothe?”  

He wheeled on her, words sharp enough to draw blood. “Because I command it. You are what I made you. Nothing more than an instrument, and instruments do not question the hand that plays them.”  

I stayed in shadow, though every fiber of my being screamed to act. This man, this voice. Was this her patron? The mysterious Master Ash she spoke of in riddles and silence?  

Denna flinched. “Please, I can’t!”  

The crack of his palm meeting her cheek snapped through the room, loud as a splitting branch. She stumbled, her hand flying to her face, and the sound she made was small and broken and lit a fire in my chest that burned away all thought of pain or caution.  

I crossed the room in three strides and put my fist into the side of his face with all the force my battered body could muster. He went down like a felled tree, his cane clattering across the floor in a rhythm like scattered bones.  

Denna turned, fear written across her swollen face. She pressed her palms against my chest, her touch gentle despite her urgency. “Don’t,” she breathed, glancing back at the fallen man. “Please, Kvothe, you have to leave.”  

But I couldn’t look away from him. The light caught his face just so, and the world tilted on its axis.  

Bredon. The owlish old man I had shared wine with. The man I had played tak with through countless Severen afternoons. The man I had called friend.  

“I see you’ve finally joined us,” he said, brushing dust from his coat as if I had done nothing more than jostle him at market. His tone was dry as autumn leaves, amused as a cat with a cornered mouse. “How wonderfully efficient.”  

My stomach churned as I stared at him, this wolf in sheep’s clothing. Memories of the Citadel, of the Cthaeh’s cruel words, screamed back at me.  

> He beats her, you know.  

“What kind of man are you?” The words tasted like copper in my mouth.  

Denna pulled at me, her voice breaking. “Kvothe, please, you promised you wouldn’t get involved.”  

But my eyes had found something else. There on the table sat a box of dark roah wood, its surface gleaming like oil on water. The Loeclos Box. My blood turned to ice, then fire, then ice again.  

“Why do you have that?” My voice came from somewhere far away.  

Denna looked at the floor, and in her silence I heard volumes. “He said he knew people who could open it,” she whispered, each word smaller than the last. “I thought if I could solve it for you, if I could hand you the answer like a gift, then maybe you wouldn’t have to go searching for answers. Maybe you would stay.”  

She leaned into me then, fragile as spun glass, her tears warm against my shirt. “Please,” she breathed against my chest. “Let’s just leave. Please.”  

For a moment, I almost listened. But then I looked at the box again, my family’s legacy sitting there like a wound. “We leave,” I said through clenched teeth, “but not without what’s mine.”  

As I stepped forward, Bredon blocked me with his cane. I grabbed his wrist to shove him aside, but before I could a sharp freezing sensation bit into my hand. I looked down to see my ring, that simple band of water-blue, crystallizing into ice.  

My breath caught as memory surged forward from the recesses of my mind.  

> You will know them by their signs.  

“Cinder.” The word eked out of my throat like poison.  

His smile spread like spilled ink, too wide for any human face. And then he wasn’t Bredon anymore. He was the creature from my nightmares, the monster who had torn my world apart and laughed while doing it.  

The air around us crackled like brittle frost. My hand flew to Caesura, and I drew her clean, the blade whispering like a drawn breath. My strikes came wild, vicious, but Cinder moved like flowing water, each of my blows cutting empty air.  

“Angry, are we?” he said mockingly, sidestepping another ill-timed slash. His grey sword, dull and lifeless as the edge of a gravestone, flashed into existence from his ash-colored robes with serpentine grace.  

I lashed out again, slamming Saicere toward his throat, but he met the strike casually, moving faster than seemed possible. Each clash of our blades sent shivers spiraling through Saicere’s edge.  

The breaking was a sound like the world ending. Like trust betraying itself. Like a heart giving up.  

Saicere fell in pieces, bright as tears.  

Before I could mourn her, before I could think, Cinder’s blade swept past me, grazing my ribs with a whisper of cold death. Then he turned to Denna.  

“Ferula!” I screamed, raising a binding, but my strength was sand through fingers, and his resistance was a ravenous force. His hand closed on Denna’s arm, and his grey blade pressed to her throat.  

“Drop what remains,” he said, his voice now low and rasping with something unhuman.  

I let Saicere hilt fall, my mind spinning helplessly.  

“Better,” Cinder said with evident amusement. And then he spoke a name, once, twice, thrice, each iteration colder than the last. “Alaxel. Alaxel. Alaxel.”  

The air tore like silk. Darkness poured through the wound, thick as old blood and cold as forgotten graves. From that darkness stepped shadows given form, and among them, one whose darkness was absolute.  

Haliax had come, and with him, the end of all things bright.  

The air turned suffocating as he spoke. “Do you have what we seek?”  

Cinder smiled, holding out the Loeclos Box and gesturing toward me. “I do, Lord Haliax. Both of them.”  

Haliax turned his attention to me, and being seen by him was like being known by the dark. When he spoke again, it was to Cinder. “Bring them. Bring everything.”  

Cinder’s blade pressed closer to Denna’s throat, drawing a thin line of red. “You heard Lord Haliax,” he said to me, his voice pleasant as poisoned honey. “Walk with us, or watch her bleed out on these filthy boards. Your choice.”  

He began backing toward the darkness Haliax had left in his wake, dragging Denna with him. The darkness hung in the air like a wound in the world, thick and grainy as wet sand. As Cinder stepped into it with Denna, they seemed to sink into its depths, the darkness pulling at them with a hungry weight.  

Denna’s eyes found mine through her tears, wide with terror. The darkness was already at her waist, drawing her down and through.  

I had no choice. I never had a choice when it came to her.  

I stepped into that grainy dark, feeling it close around me like quicksand made of shadow, cold and thick and wrong. It pulled at me with patient hunger, and I let it take me.  

For Denna. Always for Denna.
