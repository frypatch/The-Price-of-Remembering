# CHAPTER 38

## THE WOLF AND THE OWL  

THE STREETS OF Renere twisted around me like a cruel, unending maze. My steps wavered, each one a sharp reminder of the bruises still painted across my body. The shadows stretched as the sun fell lower, blurring the crooked architecture into jagged silhouettes. I had been following the compass for what felt like hours, the bobbing needle’s frantic motion my only guide. When it suddenly surged and stilled, my pulse quickened.  

I turned a corner, entering another narrow alley, and finally heard something: a man shouting. His voice was gruff and gravel-edged, the kind that cracked with too many years of practiced anger. I slowed, pressing myself to the damp brick walls. The sound came from a derelict tavern ahead, its sign hanging crooked on rusted chains.  

Moving carefully, I approached one of the boarded windows. Through the gaps, I caught sight of Denna. She was sitting inside, her head bowed, arms folded tightly in her lap. The man standing before her was tall and white-haired, his back to me as he leaned in close, his gestures wide and furious. His voice was too muffled to make out, but his tone sliced through the air like the edge of a knife.  

Instead of entering immediately, I circled to a side door and found it unlocked. Slipping inside, I stayed low and silent, creeping toward the sound of their argument. Only fragments of the conversation reached me at first.  

“This is how you repay me?” The man’s voice carried cold authority, its weight pricking at the edges of some vague memory. “After everything I’ve done for you, you lie to me?”  

“I brought what you asked for,” Denna replied, her voice trembling but steady. “Why do you need him so badly? Why does it have to be Kvothe?”  

The man spun on her, his words sharp and venomous. “Because I told you so! You don’t have to understand, only obey. You are what I made you—an instrument of my will!”  

I stayed hidden, though the urge to intervene burned in my chest. The man’s tone, the way he loomed over her, felt uncomfortably familiar. Was this him? Her patron? The enigmatic Master Ash?  

Denna flinched as he raised his hand. “Please, I can’t—”  

The crack of his palm meeting her cheek snapped through the room, loud as a splitting branch. She staggered, one hand flying to her face, her sharp intake of breath cutting into me like glass.  

I didn’t hesitate. My pain, my bruises, none of it mattered. I surged forward, closing the distance in two furious strides and driving my fist into the side of the man’s face. He sprawled back onto the wooden floorboards with a startled grunt, his cane clattering beside him.  

Denna turned, fear written across her swollen face. Her lip quivered as she stepped between us, her palms pressing against my chest. “Don’t,” she whispered urgently, glancing back at the fallen man. “Please, Kvothe, just leave.”  

I ignored her, my eyes fixed on him. Then he looked up, and so did I. The light caught his face just so, and the world turned on its head. It was Bredon.  

Bredon, the owlish old man I had shared countless cups of wine and games of Tak with in Severen. The man I had trusted.  

My stomach churned as I stared at him, this wolf in sheep’s clothing. Memories of the Citadel, of the Cthaeh’s cruel words, screamed back at me: *He beats her, you know.*  

“I see you've finally joined us,” Bredon said dryly, brushing dust from his dark, embroidered coat as though I had insulted him rather than struck him. “This makes things... efficient.” His tone cut at the edges, mocking and weightless, as if this were all just a joke.  

“You bastard,” I spat, the words hot and heavy on my tongue. “What kind of man are you?”  

Denna tugged at me, her voice pleading. “Kvothe, please, you promised you wouldn’t get involved!”  

But I couldn’t stop staring. Behind Bredon, on the table, sat something I hadn’t noticed until now—a dark roah wood box. My blood froze. “Why do you have that?” I demanded, pointing at the Loeclos Box.  

Denna didn’t answer right away. She looked at the floor, the pain on her face impossible to read. “He said… he said he could help me translate it,” she said weakly. “I thought if I gave it to him, maybe…” She choked on the words. “I just didn’t want to lose you.”  

Her voice cracked at the edges, a threadbare whisper. She leaned into me then, her warmth frail against my chest. I felt her tears wetting my shirt as she whispered, “Please, let’s just leave. Please.”  

For a moment, both rage and reason warred within me. I could see it so clearly—cross the room, take the box, and gut the man who had wormed his way into both her life and mine. But then she pressed closer, and something in me softened. “Okay,” I said through clenched teeth, “but not before I have what’s mine.”  

As I stepped forward, Bredon blocked my path with his cane. I grabbed his wrist, but before I could shove him aside, a freezing sensation bit into my hand. Sharply, unnaturally cold.  

I looked down. The ring on my finger—a simple band of water dyed pale blue—was crystallizing into ice. My breath caught as memory surged forward from the recesses of my mind: *You will know them by their signs.* My head snapped up.  

“Cinder.” The word eked out of my throat like poison.  

And then his smile shifted. It spread too far, impossibly wide. It was no longer Bredon sitting before me, but Cinder—the being who had torn my life apart, killed my parents, and laughed while doing so.  

The air around us crackled like brittle frost. My hand flew to Caesura, and I drew her clean, the blade whispering like a drawn breath. My strikes came wild, vicious, but Cinder moved like flowing water, each of my blows cutting empty air.  

“Angry, are we?” he said mockingly, sidestepping another ill-timed slash. His grey sword, dull and lifeless as the edge of a gravestone, flashed into existence from his ash-colored robes with serpentine grace.  

I lashed out again, slamming Caesura toward his throat, but he met the strike casually, moving faster than seemed possible. Each clash of our blades sent shivers spiraling through Caesura’s edge. With every parry, the sound of her strain grew louder, more dazzlingly acute, until—  

She shattered.  

The broken fragments of my blade clattered to the floor like teardrops.  

Before I could recover, Cinder’s blade swept past me, grazing my ribs with a whisper of cold death, and he turned his gaze to Denna.  

“Ferula!” I screamed, raising a binding, but my strength was fading, and his resistance was a ravenous force. He staggered but reached her regardless.  

His hand closed around her arm, dragging her close. The grey blade pressed to her throat, and my body froze. “Drop what’s left of your sword,” he said, his voice now low and rasping with something unhuman.  

I let Caesura’s hilt fall, my mind spinning helplessly.  

“Ah,” Cinder said with evident amusement. “Now we’re getting somewhere.”  

And then he spoke a name, once, twice, thrice: *Alaxel. Alaxel. Alaxel.*  

The air tore open. Darkness boiled into being with a soundless howl, taking shape as figures cloaked in shadow. One, wreathed in a mantle of all-consuming black, stepped forward.  

Haliax.  

The air turned suffocating as he spoke. “Do you have what we seek?”  

Cinder smiled, holding out the Loeclos Box and gesturing toward me. “I do, Lord Haliax. Both of them.”  

Haliax’s gaze—or what passed for a gaze—settled on me. I stepped forward, my chest heaving. I wouldn’t abandon Denna. Not now. Not ever.  

The darkness reached for me.
