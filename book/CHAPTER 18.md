# CHAPTER 18

## Define Lost  

The sky unraveled, thread by thread, as if an unseen hand were plucking it apart. Stars wheeled and drifted through it like embers shaken from a dying fire, their positions subtly, maddeningly wrong. The constellations twisted, caught in some unseen current, spiraling deeper into the dark.  

A watching sort of sky. A waiting one.  

I led us dayward, or what should have been dayward in a place where no sun shone. Felurian had once told me that moving dayward in the Fae brought you closer to stability, but the air here rang like plucked glass strings, and the ground sloped in ways that changed between blinks. If this was stability, I wanted no part of it.  

Sim stumbled at my side, filling the silence with nervous chatter, his voice straining to sound casual. Wilem kept behind us, scanning the horizon with dark, flat eyes, like a wolf pushed too far into the open.  

"We’re lost," Wilem said, quiet and certain.  

I almost denied it. I had found my way through worse. Tarbean’s alleys had been crueler than any wood, and the Archives more tangled than any maze. But the Fae did not work like streets or bookshelves neatly aligned. It was something else entirely—shifting, layered, a road that twisted as you walked it, slipping through your fingers like river mist.  

“Say it,” Wilem pressed.  

“We’re misplaced,” I muttered.  

Wilem shook his head. “Well, we’re not found.”  

Before I could argue, something changed. A sound threaded through the trees, light as a breath, quick as a shiver. Not a voice. Not quite. It curled into the hollow of my ribs like a song I had known once but could not name. It didn’t draw me forward so much as *wait* for me to come.  

“What now?” Wilem asked, his voice sharpening.  

I didn’t answer. I stepped toward the song.  

“Kvothe!” Wilem caught my arm, fingers digging into my shoulder. “You know what this is.”  

“We can’t keep wandering,” I said, pulling free. “It’s something.”  

“It’s going to be something that kills us,” Wilem snapped.  

I turned to face him. “Then I’ll go alone.”  

Wilem’s jaw clenched, but he didn’t argue. I stepped into the trees. By the time I reached the clearing’s edge, I realized I wasn’t alone.  

“You really thought we’d stay behind?” Sim asked, appearing beside me, his pale face a mix of curiosity and unease.  

I wasn’t surprised when Wilem shoved through the undergrowth behind us, muttering in Siaru under his breath.  

***  

The clearing spread before us, a window into somewhere older and stranger than we had any right to stand. Firelight flickered hungrily around shapes that were almost human—twisting, graceful limbs, faces smooth as river glass, eyes shifting silver-green in the dim glow.  

For a moment, they were dancers wrapped in firelight, each movement seamless, poetry made flesh. But as the light shifted, their difference bared itself in cruel detail: ribs that sloped too thin, fingers jointed in the wrong places, heads that dipped too sharply in amusement or curiosity.  

“They’re Fae,” Sim whispered.  

“The Faen Court,” I murmured, “Felurian described it to me.”  

A silver-haired figure stepped forward, hollow cups balanced in long, narrow fingers. Their lips curled as they looked us over, their voice humming like wind over strings.  

"No iron. No ugly things," they said. It was not a request.  

I hesitated a moment before unsheathing my knife and placing it at my feet. Sim and Wilem followed, though Wil’s grip lingered over his blade longer than was wise.  

The cup tasted of honey and thunder, thick and electric as it slid down my throat. I had barely set it down when another figure stepped forward—sleek and sharp, hair like living flame, eyes like smoldering amber.  

“If you want safe passage,” she said, her voice musical and precise, “you will dance.”  

Sim blanched. “Dance?”  

I stepped forward, trusting to luck that I would not embarrass myself. “We’ll dance.”  

The first steps were deliberate, measured. But the music had other intentions. The rhythm folded over itself and pressed against my ribs like a second pulse. The ground hummed beneath my feet. And before I knew it, the dance was inside me, turning movement into necessity.  

Beside me, Sim faltered, stumbling out of step with something like sickness on his face. I caught his arm and pulled away from the fire.  

***  

We had barely cleared the tree line before Sim collapsed to his knees and retched into the undergrowth.  

“Remind me *never* to drink something handed to me by strangers,” he groaned.  

I crouched beside him, shaking off a lingering dizziness. Something flickered at the edges of my vision—deep orange, half-hidden between the twisting shapes of the trees.  

An orchard.  

The gnarled branches draped low, their fruit gleaming like molten copper. The shapes of them stirred something deep and half-remembered, like a song in another language.  

Sim stumbled forward before I could stop him.  

“Don’t—”  

Too late. Sim plucked one of the fruits and bit into it. Juice dripped down his chin, catching on his lips like fire-lit gold.  

“It tastes the same,” he murmured in faint surprise, turning to look at me. “You should—”  

I slapped the fruit from his hands.  

For a moment, we stood in silence, his expression caught between confusion and hurt. Then, somewhere behind us, there was a sound. A snap of branches. The quiet, deliberate weight of approaching steps.  

A Fae figure emerged from the trees, silent and watching, their spear leveled at my throat.  

Black eyes. Long, twisting limbs. The Thiani.  

Sim went still, breath caught. The Fae’s dark gaze flicked from him to me to the half-eaten fruit lying in the dirt. Her mouth opened, and a shrill, furious sound carved through the forest.  

I raised my hands slowly. “Wait—”  

But the air was already filling with voices, moving closer.  

***  

The hum of voices swelled and shrank, a tide of sound rising sharp and eerie as we were herded into the wide center of the clearing. Everything felt strange, far-off, untethered. My stomach swayed beneath me like a boat taking on water.   

“The Talamas Grove has been defiled,” the Thiani leader growled, striking the butt of her spear against the ground. The sharp *thunk* of it rattled in my skull. “There must be justice!”  

The assembled crowd muttered and spat, the sound of it thick and wrong in my ears. I half-registered it, but my world was still sluggish, spinning from too many spirits, too much laughter, all of it soured now.  

Then, a voice. Soft, calm. Absolute.  

“Bring them forward.”  

The crowd parted.  

There was a man standing there, tall and still. He wasn’t wearing a crown or armor, but he didn’t need to. His presence alone pulled everything to him, like a silent command.  

I blinked at him. Something about him felt important. Sharp-edged and inevitable.  

“High Lord Remmen,” the Thiani intoned, her voice a blade cutting through butter. “These humans were caught eating from the sacred grove.”  

*Remmen,* I thought vaguely. *That’s bad, isn’t it?* The name curled sluggishly in my mind, like I ought to recognize it. A story, half-remembered. Something about twilight, something about… *oh.*  

Right.  

Lord of Twilight. The Telwyth Mael.  

A weight settled uneasily in my gut.  

Remmen tilted his head slightly, those burning violet eyes considering us. Not cruel, not theatrical. He didn’t need to *act* like he held power. He simply *did.*  

“Is this true?” he asked.  

Sim made a sound. It might have been a word.  

Remmen’s gaze turned to him, expectant.  

“No,” Simmon managed, stumbling over the single syllable. His voice was thick, unsteady, barely more than a breath. If I had been sober, I might have shut my eyes in despair.  

Remmen simply sighed. Not angry. Not pitying. Just… tired.    

“Your hand,” he said, extending his own.  

Sim blinked at him, swaying slightly. “Huh?”  

Remmen didn’t repeat himself. He just waited.  

A long, awful moment passed. Then, hazily obedient, Simmon held out his hand. His fingers were smudged in the low light, stained deep in the lines of his palm. The soft orange of crushed flesh, half-mashed under his nails.  

A sharp intake of breath. The sound of hissing, low and seething.  

“A thief and a liar!” someone spat.  

Remmen did not raise his voice. He did not need to.  

“Hang them over the Black Morass,” he said, already turning away.  

***

Thankfully, when Remmen had demanded we hang, he hadn’t meant by the neck, instead we were thrust at spearpoint into a large, elaborately woven orb of roots and vines, and left to dangle over a putrid swamp. Our initial relief that we weren't to be fitted for nooses, gave way after a few hours inside our cramped and uncomfortable cage, the whole thing twisting and creaking when any of us so much as moved.  

Sim groaned. “My head feels like Kilvin clamped it in a vice.”  

Wilem, tense beside him, didn’t look up. “Next time, don’t eat fruit that glows.”  

Sim let out something close to a laugh. Then, quieter, “I haven’t had persimmons since I was a child.”  

Wilem stilled for a moment, then turned to him. “Persimmons?”  

A hesitant nod. “My parents had an estate outside Renere. They grew wild along the cliffs. That’s why,” he muttered, glaring at nothing in particular, “they named me Persimmon.”  

A slow beat of silence stretched between the three of us.  

“You’re joking,” I said.  

“Hardly.”  

Wilem let out a sharp breath, the faintest flicker of a smirk at the edge of it. “And you’ve let us call you Sim this entire time?”  

Sim shifted. “I prefer it.”  

“Hearing this now feels like a betrayal, Persimmon.”  

Sim groaned and slumped back against the cage, resting his head on his arms. “Are we going to die here?”  

“No.” I hadn’t meant it to come out so sure, but there it was. Woven from a deeper place than reason. “I promise you—we’ll find a way.”  

As they drifted into exhausted quiet, my focus drifted elsewhere—to the pack left unattended on the wooden platform. Wilem’s knife. Perhaps, if I could call the Name of Iron—if I could *reach* it—  

I felt Wilem watching me.  

“That's your plan?” he said incredulously.  

I said nothing. His gaze lingered, testing me for an answer I didn’t have yet.  

***  

Time in the Fae does not pass. It pools. It thins. It twists itself into ribbons and knots. There is no sunrise, no ticking clock. But gradually, the air around us *brightened*, not as if dawn had come, but as if the darkness had simply grown tired and slunk away to gather itself elsewhere.  

We were cut from our cage before I had time to stiffen against the fall. The ground met my feet too soon, too suddenly, as if it had been farther away just a breath before.  

The Court was gathered again, though it was quieter now. Even the ever-present hum of unseen things was subdued, as if the world was waiting for our story to resolve.  

Remmen sat upon the great twisted roots of a massive tree, his sharp features carved from twilight-stained stone. Even at rest, his presence *waited* in the air around him, thrumming with quiet authority.  

The Thiani stepped forward like a blade drawn from its sheath. “They have defiled the Talamas Grove,” she announced. “There must be justice.”  

“What,” Remmen mused, “must be done?”  

“They have no place here,” the Thiani intoned, “One clean stroke. The head will do.”  

Sim made a strangled noise in his throat.  

I stiffened. “You would kill a man over fruit?”  

Laughter—quiet and knife-sharp—ghosted through the crowd.  

The Thiani did not smile. “It was no mere fruit. It was a sacred offering.” A beat. “Such theft is blasphemy.”  

The word dropped like a stone into deep water.  

Remmen shook his head.  

Sensing she'd overstepped the mark on what was deemed fair punishment, the Thiani proposed another form of retribution.  

“Cut out this one's tongue,” she said, pointing to Sim.  

“No,” I said, and there was iron in my voice.  

Remmen eyes narrowed, “No? And who are you to decide in matters of this court?”  

I swallowed. You cannot argue with the Fae. Logic is a poor weapon against stories older than stone.  

But *games*.  

I lifted my chin. “I challenge the sentence in the old ways.”  

There was a stir in the gathered crowd. Some murmured in interest, others in something closer to amusement.  

Remmen’s lips curled faintly. “You would challenge me?”  

I held my ground, though my heart had begun a slow, warning drum in my chest. “I would.”  

Remmen regarded me solemnly for a long moment. Then, with a gesture sharp as falling leaves, he summoned a group of attendants.  

They moved quickly. A small wooden table was set before us. A board was placed upon it. My breath hitched in realization. *Tak.*  

The humming murmur of the Fae around us told me everything I needed to know. This was no idle amusement here. This was not a courtly game for bored nobility.  

Tak mattered. And now it mattered more than anything.  

Remmen’s violet gaze met mine. He reached forward, placing his first piece.  

I let my breath settle. Slow. Sure. Not too careful. Not too slow.  

I laid my first stone cleanly upon the board.  

*Play to be good.*  

Remmen played his next piece, studying the board, studying me. There was no hesitation, no deliberation in his movements. He played like the board was already set in his mind, each piece clicking into place according to a rhythm I could not hear.  

I laid my next piece.  

*Play to be better.*  

Remmen’s strategy bent and shifted like water moving through cracks in stone—fluid, effortless. Each move carried the weight of something deeply practiced.  

I adjusted. I did not try to match him piece for piece, speed for speed. Instead, I played something looser, something uncertain. I tilted my head, let my fingers hover just a moment too long over the board. I let hesitation glimmer at the edges of my expression. Not too much. Just enough.  

Doubt is a baited hook. Fear is a blade.  

A single small crease formed at Remmen’s brow. He took my hesitation as carelessness. My looseness as lack of understanding. He leaned into the opening I gave him.  

*Tak is not about winning,* I reminded myself. *It is about making a beautiful game.*  

With a final, measured movement, I placed my stone. It settled with a deliberate, whispering click.  

The fire crackled. The air between us held still.  

Then, softly, I spoke. “Tak.”  

The board rested between us. The crowd murmured.  

Remmen studied the Tak board for a long moment. Then, with the slow certainty of an autumn wind shaking leaves free from their branches, he brushed the stones aside.  

“Well played,” he murmured.  

I allowed myself a breath. A slow blink. A moment to believe I had *actually* won.  

Remmen turned toward the gathered court. "A victor must receive their due."  

I forced myself to keep still. “My due?”  

His violet eyes lifted to meet mine, unreadable. “A wager was made. A cost set. Payment is mine to give.”  

In this moment I had little doubt that, had I lost, the price would have been carved from my body—the smooth certainty of the Fae’s sense of fairness had all but assured that. I had won, and so they assumed I expected some compensation. Safe passage, perhaps. A trinket with more history than it rightfully should have.  

But then the Court stirred.  

A figure stepped forward from the press of watching Fae, and everything in me went still.  

He was young, thin and bright as a candle flickering in restless air. His hair was a mess of inky curls that caught the firelight at their edges, glinting deep blue like raven feathers. His eyes—*God's body*, his *eyes*—burned a bright, impossible blue, clever and wild. They locked onto me without hesitation, without uncertainty, without *fear*.  

Not a child’s gaze. Not entirely.  

“This is your prize,” Remmen murmured.  

A cold knot formed in my chest. “A child?”  

Remmen smiled. “Such a small word for what he is.”  

Around us, the Court rumbled with a low, lilting murmur. Some curious. Some amused.  

I glanced down at the boy—this impossible boy—half-expecting him to look uncertain, surprised, confused. He did not.  

Instead, he studied me with a careful, assessing sort of curiosity. Testing. Separating me into pieces with those uncanny blue eyes as if he could weigh my worth in a single glance.  

“*What exactly have I won?*” I asked, suddenly unsure of where I stood.  

“My son,” Remmen said simply. “The Prince of Twilight.”  

Something inside me *pulled*, as if some invisible thread had just been looped into the stitching of my life.  

Simmon staggered upright beside me, his breath caught in his throat. Wilem swore in Siaru, flat and inevitable.  

I opened my mouth. Closed it. I fought for a thread of sense. There was none.  

I turned back to Remmen, narrowing my eyes. “Why?”  

Remmen studied me. “You called for the old ways.”  

“And in what old tale does a game of Tak win a man a prince?”  

Remmen tilted his head, a slow, knowing motion.  

“In *all* of them.”  

And I *understood*.  

This was not the world I had known. Not a place governed by the rules of merchants and men, where debts wore neat ledgers and promises broke like brittle twigs.  

This was the Fae. Their laws did not live on paper, but in *story*. I had claimed an old right, demanded justice by an older law. And in stories—true stories, the lasting ones—what did victory bring?  

A wife. A throne. A great beast to be tamed. A lost prince waiting to be shaped.  

The son of a king.  

In this world, it made *perfect sense.* Because nothing here was given. Only earned. And I had earned *him*.  

My throat tightened. “You would give me your son, just like that?”  

Remmen’s smile did not reach his eyes. “No. I would give you my son *because of that*.”  

I turned back toward the boy, expecting defiance or resistance. But the scruffy urchin only grinned at me, bright and sharp as a blade catching moonlight—a grin like trouble tied in silk and lace.  

***

Within the Waystone, Bast looked over the table indignantly. “Who are you calling an urchin?”
