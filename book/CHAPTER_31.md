# CHAPTER 31.

## THE DECEIT.


DIRT CLUNG TO every inch of me—my boots, my shirt, even my teeth. By the time we reached the Blind Beggar, night had folded over the city like worn velvet. My ribs ached with every breath, but I didn’t let us slow. Denna followed without a sound.

I knocked. A shuffle, the scrape of a chair, then Bast swung the door open. “Finally. I was starting to think you'd gone and gotten yourself—oh!” His eyes widened as he caught sight of Denna. 

Behind him, Sim and Wil leaned forward from their seats, their expressions shifting from relief to alarm. 

“Denna! Good lord, what happened to you?” Sim asked, half-rising. His voice brimmed with that anxious kindness that might irritate if it weren’t so unerringly genuine. 

“Fell off my horse,” Denna said casually, brushing past him like a ghost propped up by borrowed grace. “Got anything to eat?” She paused, her empty hands hanging loosely by her side. “I'm starving.”

“Er... I think Wil has half an onion left from earlier,” Sim offered hesitantly. 

“An onion?” Denna blinked, her voice half incredulous, half amused. “Just... an onion?” 

“It’s on a stick,” Wil said as flatly as ever. “But if you’re not interested—” 

“God’s teeth, it might as well be roasted lamb,” she said, holding her hands out toward him. “Pass it over.” 

As she moved through the room, she carried that odd air of hers, light and unshakable, despite the shadows beneath her eyes. I, by contrast, collapsed into a chair and began the laborious task of prying off my boots. 

I didn’t want to say it aloud. The words already tasted like old ash. But Sim just looked at me with the same hopeful expression he always wore: too kind, too human for days like these.

“So,” I asked, looking between Wil and Sim, “any luck?”

Wil answered first, his voice clipped. “We got the letter into his hands. Taliver helped. But either it never left the servants’ floor... or he read it and ignored it.”

“He ignored it,” Sim murmured. “He has to have.”

“Then the court is deaf on both ends,” I said. “The Maer wasn't cruel—just... absent. Cloaked in formality, drowning in caution. He knows something’s coming but would rather wait in safety.” 

Bast made a low growling sound, rolled his shoulders. “We’re running out of cards.”

I looked at him, letting the weight of it settle before I spoke. “It’s worse than you think.”

“Oh, good,” Wil muttered, trying too hard to sound casual. “Let me guess—Jakis is having tea with the Maer, or a horde of Shamblemen’s about to crash the city gates?” 

“I wish you were exaggerating,” I said. “I really do.”

“We spotted an army. Jakis’ colors flying high. They’re camped in a ravine less than two hours from here. Waiting.” 

Sim set the onion down carefully, like it had begun to hum.

“I think I’d rather take my chances with the Shamblemen.”

Wil cursed under his breath. Bast’s posture sharpened, like a bow pulled taut. “If they’re that close,” he said, “why not bring it straight to the King?”

I shook my head. “Roderick’s buried beneath silk-tongued flatterers. News worse than ours won’t reach him for a month—if ever.”

“Or ever. It’s not King Roderick’s court anymore,” Sim said bitterly. “It’s a curtain.”

Bast muttered a curse in Faen, low and sharp as broken glass. “Fools die prettiest when the silk’s still warm.”

Wil and Sim exchanged a look. It was short, but heavy as an anchor.

“What?” I asked.

Wil cleared his throat, folding his hands. “It’s not that we don’t agree. We do. It’s just... we’ve started cooking up something else. Not elegant. Not even lawful. But it might be the only way to shake the right trees.”

“Tell me.”

“We start,” Sim said, his voice thin. He glanced toward Denna, then back to me. “With kidnapping.”

### * * *

The sound of my boots against stone echoed in the drafty citadel halls. Despite my disguise—the gaudy green and gold uniform of the royal tailor—I felt each clap of my steps as loud as cymbals. 

“Not much further now,” said my escort, a little man named Galeshim with a drawn face and hurried gait. He barked incessantly at anyone in our way. “Out of the hall! Move aside! Important business, make way!”

I adjusted the absurd bundle of fabric in front of me, frilly and blindingly white. The thing was heavy, reeking faintly of lavender and starch. All the while, my face itched under its mask—the fiery red hair and sharp angles of Kvothe erased by the glamourie Bast had so carefully wrought. In my reflection, I no longer saw myself, but Artemi Ilario: tanned, aging, and wearier than anyone rightly deserved to look.

We approached a doorway flanked by two guards wearing the King’s red and gold. Their expressions might as well have been carved into granite. 

“Open the door,” Galeshim demanded, making a short shooing motion to punctuate his words.

Neither guard moved. 

“Are you deaf? We have urgent business. This is His Majesty’s personal tailor. He requires access at once.” 

The guards were not inclined to respond. Galeshim’s lips pursed like he’d bitten into something sour. “Need I remind you of the King’s temper when things are left imperfect? Or will you explain to Lady Almira why her dress was delayed?” 

They shifted uneasily but did not part. Galeshim turned to me, exasperated but hopeful. “Do something.”

I stepped forward, adjusting my burden as I showed my face properly beneath the hall's dim lighting. Aging. Stern. A stranger. All pieces of the glamourie. “As much as I’d like to prattle all night,” I hissed in an accent whose Modegan lilt I’d studied over the span of two desperate hours, “I’ve no time for stubborn oafs with more muscle than sense.”

The younger guard flinched. The elder one stepped aside with a simple “My apologies.” 

Inside the room, light spilled from tall windows onto gilded mirrors and tables scattered with jewelry. A figure sat at a dressing table, a murmuring throng of maids hemming and pinning ribbons on pale swathes of fabric.

I gave the thin stick hidden in my sleeve two deliberate shakes—the signal. A clever trinket of Wil’s, bound to Alar enough to send a faint response to others across the Citadel. Somewhere near the outer gates, I knew, the others would be waiting. Watching.

The maids before me paused, some stiffening while others looked up in confusion. 

“Ladies,” I began, stepping fully into stance, “His Majesty requires adjustments. Unshackle me from your work; I’ll be quick about it.”

“Well, we weren’t expecting—!” one began, but I clapped twice, sharp and quick. 

“Go. Now.”

One by one, they gathered their things and scurried out until I was alone with the figure at the mirror. Her head inclined downward, her frame delicate, her radiance muted by quiet sorrow. 

I stepped closer, shaking free of the empty persona I’d worn. “Auri,” I said softly, almost disbelievingly.

She turned, her wide eyes meeting mine. A moment passed, then another. Then recognition roused her. “Kvothe?”

“Yes.” 

She was up and in my arms before I’d finished the word. Her weight was slight as a bird’s, and I feared she might vanish into thin air. Then she laughed, half through tears, and murmured, “What did you bring me?”

A crash rattled the door. My body tensed. “We have to move,” I whispered, retrieving the alchemical vial Sim had handed me with far too much confidence earlier. 

The substance stank like vinegar left to spoil in sugared ale. I worked it over my palms quickly, testing its tackiness against the stone of the window to ensure it held. 

“This is safe, yes?” Auri asked, her brows knitting.

A harder crash at the door answered for me. “Safe enough.”

“Splendid.”

I lowered myself onto the wall, the Citadel sprawling beneath us like a long, gleaming tale. Auri clung to my neck. Each movement felt deliberate, muscle and bone straining against every instinct that screamed not to let go.

Then came the slick sound of my palm slipping against the stone. All at once, the gel began to give way. 

“There!” a voice shouted from the balcony above us. “He’s escaping! After him!”

“We’ll be alright,” she said, though it carried the fragile weight of a prayer.

And I couldn’t answer her. Not yet.
