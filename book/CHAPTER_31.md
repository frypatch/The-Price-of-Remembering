# CHAPTER 31.

## THE DECEIT.


DIRT CLUNG TO every inch of me, coating my boots, my shirt, and even my teeth. By the time we reached the Blind Beggar, night had folded over the city like worn velvet. My ribs ached with every breath, but I didn’t let us slow. Denna followed without a sound.  

I knocked. A shuffle, the scrape of a chair, then Bast swung the door open. “Finally. I was starting to think you’d gone and gotten yourself,” he began, but his words died when he saw Denna. “Oh!” His eyes widened as he caught sight of her.  

Behind him, Sim and Wil leaned forward from their seats, their expressions shifting from relief to alarm.  

“Denna! Good lord, what happened to you?” Sim asked, half-rising. His voice brimmed with that anxious kindness that might irritate if it weren’t so unerringly genuine.  

“Fell off my horse,” Denna said, brushing past him like a ghost propped up by borrowed grace. “Got anything to eat?” She paused, her empty hands hanging loosely by her side. “I'm starving.”  

“Er, I think Wil has half an onion left from earlier,” Sim offered hesitantly.  

“An onion?” Denna blinked, her voice half incredulous, half amused. “Just an onion?”  

“It’s on a stick,” Wil said as flatly as ever. “But if you’re not interested,” he began, but Denna cut him off.  

“God’s teeth, it might as well be roasted lamb,” she said, holding her hands out toward him. “Pass it over.”  

As she moved through the room, she carried that odd air of hers, light and unshakable, despite the shadows beneath her eyes. I, by contrast, collapsed into a chair and began the laborious task of prying off my boots.  

I didn’t want to say it aloud. The words already tasted like old ash. But Sim just looked at me with the same hopeful expression he always wore, too kind, too human for days like these.  

“So,” I asked, looking between Wil and Sim, “any luck?”  

Wil answered first, his voice clipped. “We got the letter into his hands. Taliver helped. But either it never left the servants’ floor or he read it and ignored it.”  

“He ignored it,” Sim murmured. “He has to have.”  

“Then the court is deaf on both ends,” I said. “The Maer wasn't cruel, just absent. Cloaked in formality, drowning in caution. He knows something’s coming but would rather wait in safety.”  

Bast made a low growling sound, rolled his shoulders. “We’re running out of cards.”  

I looked at him, letting the weight of it settle before I spoke. “It’s worse than you think.”  

“Oh, good,” Wil muttered, trying too hard to sound casual. “Let me guess, Jakis is having tea with the Maer, or a horde of Shamblemen is about to crash the city gates?”  

“I wish you were exaggerating,” I said. “I really do.”  

“We spotted an army. Jakis’ colors flying high. They’re camped in a ravine less than two hours from here. Waiting.”  

Sim set the onion down carefully, like it had begun to hum.  

“I think I’d rather take my chances with the Shamblemen.”  

Wil cursed under his breath. Bast’s posture sharpened, like a bow pulled taut. “If they’re that close,” he said, “why not bring it straight to the King?”  

I shook my head. “Roderick’s buried beneath silk-tongued flatterers. News worse than ours won’t reach him for a month, if ever.”  

“Or ever. It’s not King Roderick’s court anymore,” Sim said bitterly. “It’s a curtain.”  

Bast muttered a curse in Faen, low and sharp as broken glass. “Fools die prettiest when the silk’s still warm.”  

Wil and Sim exchanged a look. It was short, but heavy as an anchor.  

“What?” I asked.  

Wil cleared his throat, folding his hands. “It’s not that we don’t agree. We do. It’s just that we’ve started cooking up something else. Not elegant. Not even lawful. But it might be the only way to shake the right trees.”  

“Tell me.”  

“We start,” Sim said, his voice thin. He glanced toward Denna, then back to me. “With kidnapping.”  

### * * *  

The sound of my boots on stone echoed in the cold halls of the citadel. Despite the disguise I wore, a garish uniform in green and gold belonging to the royal tailor, each step sounded loud enough to wake the dead.  

“Not much further now,” said my escort, a short man named Galeshim whose face was pinched and his pace relentless. He snapped endlessly at those who crossed our path. “Out of the way, move aside, urgent business!”  

I shifted the cumbersome bundle of fabric in my arms, frilled and blindingly white. It was heavier than it looked, smelling faintly of lavender and starch. My skin itched beneath the false mask I wore, my flame-red hair and sharp edges erased by Bast’s carefully woven glamourie. When I glanced at my reflection, I saw Artemi Ilario, a man with weathered skin and weary eyes, far older than his years.  

We reached a doorway guarded by two soldiers clad in the King’s crimson and gold. They stood unmoving, expressions carved from stone.  

“Open the door,” Galeshim commanded, waving his hands impatiently.  

Neither guard stirred.  

“Are you deaf?” he snapped. “This is the King’s personal tailor. Let us through at once.”  

The guards glanced at each other but did not budge. Galeshim’s mouth twitched, his confidence faltering. He turned to the guards again, more wary now than commanding. “Gentlemen, I assure you, this delay is not only discourteous, it is dangerous. If the King finds fault in the gown’s fit, it will not be my name he speaks with displeasure.”  

Still, they held fast. Galeshim turned to me then, offering a stiff, apologetic gesture. “Perhaps, good master, you might impress upon them the urgency.”  

Stepping forward, I lifted my chin and let the dim torchlight reveal the face Bast had crafted for me. Older. Sterner. A stranger’s face entirely. I spoke in an accent carefully learned from a few hurried hours spent in desperate study. “I’d love to waste the night here exchanging empty words,” I said sharply, “but I’ve no patience left for thick-headed guards who confuse stubbornness with duty.”  

The younger guard flinched, and the older stepped aside, mumbling an apology.  

Within, lamplight spilled from high windows onto mirrors edged with gold and tables strewn with jewelry. A figure sat before a mirror, surrounded by maids hemming and pinning ribbons on pale swathes of fabric.  

I shook the thin stick hidden within my sleeve, two quick flicks serving as the signal. A clever toy from Wil, bound with Alar enough to send a faint pulse through the citadel. At the outer gates, the others would be waiting and watching.  

The maids around me paused, some freezing mid-motion, others glancing upward uncertainly.  

“Ladies,” I began firmly, stepping fully into the role I wore, “His Majesty has sent me to make adjustments. Unburden yourselves of this task. Quickly.”  

“We weren’t expecting anyone!” began one maid, but I clapped twice, sharp and firm.  

“Go. Now.”  

They gathered their sewing baskets hastily, hurrying out until I stood alone with the figure at the dressing table. Her head bowed slightly, frame slender, her brightness veiled by quiet sadness.  

Stepping closer, I shook off the mask Bast had given me. “Auri,” I breathed, the name almost a question.  

Slowly, she turned, her wide eyes meeting mine. One heartbeat passed, then another, before recognition blossomed on her face. “Kvothe?”  

“Yes.”  

She rose and was in my arms before the word was fully spoken. She felt slight as a bird, as if a strong wind might whisk her away. She laughed through tears, holding tightly to me as she whispered, “What have you brought me?”  

A heavy crash shook the door. My body tensed instantly. “We need to leave,” I whispered, pulling out the  alchemical vial Sim had handed me with far too much confidence earlier.  

The liquid inside smelled like spoiled vinegar mixed with stale ale. Quickly, I smeared it onto my palms, pressing one hand against the stone of the window to test its hold.  

“It’s safe, yes?” Auri asked softly, eyebrows drawn together.  

A louder crash came from the door, answering before I could. “Safe enough.”  

“Splendid.”  

I eased myself onto the outer wall, the sprawling citadel below glittering like a jewel-studded tale. Auri wrapped her arms around my neck as every movement became deliberate, each muscle straining against instinct and gravity.  

Then came the slick, sliding sensation as my palm began to slip against stone. The gel loosened, its hold weakening rapidly.  

“There,” someone shouted from above us. “He’s escaping! After him!”  

“We’ll be alright,” Auri whispered. Her words trembled like a hopeful prayer.  

And I couldn’t answer her. Not yet.
