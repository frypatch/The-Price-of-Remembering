# CHAPTER 12.

## EVERYTHING.


MY HANDS BEGAN to shake on the fourteenth night.  

Not badly. Not enough that Devi noticed, or at least not enough that she commented. But I felt it. A fine tremor that started in my fingers and worked its way up through my wrists. I told myself it was exhaustion. The long nights, the double life, the constant vigilance. Anyone would shake under that kind of strain.  

But I knew better.  

The damage from the potion had never healed. Like Master Herma, I’d simply learned to ignore it, to work around the moments when my Alar slipped or my concentration fractured. I’d built walls around the broken places in my mind and pretended they weren’t there.  

Now those walls were beginning to crack.  

I caught myself losing time. One moment I would be scraping stone, the next I would be standing at the other side of the courtyard with no memory of moving. Small moments, easily dismissed. But they were growing more frequent.  

In classes, my attention would splinter without warning. I would be listening to Master Dal lecture on advanced sympathy, and suddenly I would be somewhere else. Standing before the Four-Plate Door in my dreams, watching light pulse through the keyholes.  

Worst of all was the Alar.  

I had always been able to split my mind with precision. Two bindings, three, even four running simultaneously. It had been the foundation of my talent, the thing that made me exceptional. Now even two was a struggle. The connections would form and then slip, like trying to grip water. I would reach for the certainty that had always been there, and find only fog.  

So I hid it. From Devi, from my friends, from everyone. I was Kvothe, after all. Kvothe the prodigy, Kvothe who had called the wind. I couldn’t be broken. I refused to be broken.  

I buried the fear beneath the work, and I kept going.  

### * * *  

The next day I skipped classes to meet up with Wil and Sim. I had not been to Anker’s for days, perhaps weeks. It was getting harder to tell. But I was hopeful that the fresh air would clear my head.  

They were sitting in Anker’s courtyard, watching the foot traffic drift by in chairs that looked two strong gusts away from collapse. The sight of them brought relief I hadn’t known I needed.  

“Look who’s emerged,” Sim said as I slumped into the chair across from them. “We were starting to think you’d forgotten us.”  

“You smell like cinnamon,” Wil observed.  

Sim leaned forward, his grin maddeningly wide. “It’s because he’s been busy courting a fairy queen in Imre. Or haven’t you heard?”  

It took me half a second too long to realize what they were talking about, and the look on my face immediately set Sim off into laughter. Wilem smothered a grin of his own, taking a deliberate sip from his mug.  

“Devi?” I finally said, forcing my best frown of incredulity. “You honestly think I’m sneaking off to Devi’s room every night for some grand, torrid affair?”  

“Well, you’re certainly sneaking off somewhere,” Sim countered with far too much satisfaction. “And all signs point to Imre. I’m not saying I disapprove, but I’m also not saying I want to know the details. I’m trying to respect her privacy.”  

I groaned and cast a look at Wilem, waiting for a rescue. But Wil simply smirked and leaned back in his chair, content to watch me dig my way out of this one.  

“Okay, enough,” I began, but before I could finish, Sim raised a hand solemnly.  

“But you should know,” he went on, quieter this time, “Denna was in town. She came by the courtyard. She asked about you.”  

My forced grin faltered. Wil’s brow knit almost imperceptibly.  

“And?” I said, feigning a lightness any audience would have seen through.  

Sim shifted in his chair. He rubbed the back of his neck in that way he did when searching for tact.  

“We said we didn’t know where you’d gone,” he murmured, eyes fixed on the table. “We might have let her think you’d found company. That you were busy. That sort of busy.”  

He shrugged, small and sheepish.  

“We didn’t mean to,” he added. “But Denna, she has a way of pressing. With her, vague words are only invitations. The more careful your answer, the more questions she asks.”  

They waited expectantly.  

I summoned my charm, hoping my smile would hold. “You’re not wrong,” I said, the words falling easy and practiced. “Devi’s not entirely intolerable company.”  

Sim blinked, open-mouthed. “Wait. You’re saying you-?”  

“I’m saying what I’m saying,” I finished smoothly, sipping from Wil’s neglected mug.  

Sim was too flustered to answer, but relief passed over his face.  

Wil watched him across the table, silent and careful. For a moment he looked at me, something curious in his expression. Then the moment passed as the noise of Anker’s courtyard filled the space between us. Clatter and low laughter.  

The conversation moved away. But my thoughts didn’t.  

Denna had been looking for me. And now Sim and Wil, my ever-loyal and well-meaning friends, had ensured she would never try again.  

### * * *  

The stone gave way without warning.  

One moment, I was scraping at the depression we’d spent three spans wearing into the courtyard flagstone. The next, a piece of stone the size of my fist tumbled into darkness below. Cold air rushed up through the opening, carrying the smell of dust and old parchment.  

I froze, my scraping tool still in hand. Devi’s head snapped up from where she was preparing the next application of acid.  

“Did you?” she breathed.  

I didn’t answer. I was staring down into the hole, into a blackness my eyes couldn’t penetrate. Devi let out a sound that was halfway between a laugh and a sob. “We did it. Kvothe, we actually did it.”  

We widened the hole carefully, working with manic precision. The stone crumbled more easily now, as if the room below was pulling us in. Within an hour, the opening was large enough to climb through.  

I went first.  

I lowered myself down, hanging by my fingertips before dropping the last few feet. The floor was stone, solid beneath my boots. I stood in perfect darkness and fumbled for my thief’s lamp.  

The blue-green light spread outward, and I saw.  

The room was longer than it was wide, with a low ceiling and walls of the same grey stone as the rest of the Archives. But every inch of those walls was lined with shelves.  

Books. Scrolls. Bound ledgers thick as a hand’s width. Loose documents tied with ribbon gone brittle with age. Small chests with brass hasps, their contents unknown. Clay tablets stacked like dinner plates. Rolled maps with edges turned to lace by time. Everything covered in dust so thick it looked like grey snow.  

The air was cold and still, perfectly preserved. I could smell old leather, the mineral tang of clay, and underneath it all the scent of parchment untouched for centuries.  

I took a step forward, my boot leaving a clear print in the undisturbed dust. My lamplight fell on the nearest shelf, and I saw spines with titles in languages I recognized and languages I didn’t. Temic. Aturan. Yllish knots. A script that might have been Siaru or might have been older still. Some volumes bore preservation sygaldry, faintly glowing in my lamp’s light. Others were cracked and crumbling, held together by nothing more than stillness.  

“Kvothe?” Devi’s voice came from above, tight with impatience. “What do you see?”  

I opened my mouth, but what could I say. I was looking at the answer to every question I’d ever asked. The truth about the Chandrian. The Amyr. The doors of stone. My parents’ deaths. It was what I’d been searching for since I was eleven years old. All of it, waiting.  

“Everything,” I breathed. “I see everything.”  

### * * *  

The scope of what we’d found became clear over the following nights.  

The room held records. Hundreds of them, perhaps thousands. Old documents, carefully preserved, detailing things that had been deliberately removed from the Archives above. It was exactly what I’d hoped for. A repository of forbidden knowledge, long forgotten.  

But it was too much.  

“We can’t take any of this, not even your donation,” Devi said on our second night in the room, gesturing at the shelves with frustration. “If we remove books, someone might notice. If we try to smuggle out stacks of documents, we’ll be caught for certain.”  

“We copy them,” I said.  

“By hand? Kvothe, there are hundreds of texts here. It would take years.”  

She was right. I spent the rest of that night doing the mathematics of our discovery. We had found everything, and we couldn’t take any of it.  

The solution came to me in the Archives, of all places.  

I was researching foreign cataloging systems when I stumbled across a reference to scribal practices in the Aturan Empire. Those old archivists had developed systems for compressing information, shorthand ciphers that could reduce a page of text to a quarter of its length. The techniques had fallen out of use centuries ago, but the principles were documented.  

I spent three days studying everything I could find. Merchant codes. Diplomatic ciphers. The compressed notations used by ship captains to log voyages. None of them were quite right, but the bones were there.  

In the Fishery, I constructed a different kind of tool. A pantograph rig. A simple mechanical that could reproduce text at a reduced scale. The principle used by artists and cartographers for generations. I simply adapted it to our needs.  

When I showed Devi the system, the shorthand cipher I’d developed, and the scaling rig that could shrink a page to a quarter of its size, she understood immediately.  

“One page becomes four lines,” she said. “We can carry out entire books in our pockets.”  

“It’s not perfect. The shorthand takes time to learn, and the scaling makes the text harder to read. But it works.”  

She took the practice sheet from my hands, studying the compressed symbols. “You made this?”  

“I adapted it. From older systems.”  

“It’s brilliant.” She looked at me, and I thought I saw admiration there. “You’re full of surprises, aren’t you?”  

I shrugged, uncomfortable with the praise. But I felt a flush of pride despite myself. We had found a way. A reckless and impossible way, but a way nonetheless.
