# CHAPTER 12.

## THREADS UNRAVEL.


DEVI’S ROOM SMELLED SHARP, like ink left too long on a hot iron. There was a hunger in the air, a thin tension that vibrated in the spaces between oil-slicked brass, faintly glowing sympathy wax, and pages full of frantic, scrawled equations. It felt like the room itself was restless, as though our sleepless nights had seeped into the wood of the walls.  

Our creation sat on the only cleared surface in the room, cobbled together from wire and wood, shaped not with elegance but desperation. It was a strange, squat thing, a birdcage mangled and bent into something new. It whirred quietly, its uneven rhythm filling the room like the breath of something alive.  

Devi sat cross-legged on the table next to it, her hair loose and wild, like she’d run her fingers through it too many times to count. Her sharp eyes were locked on the device. I was leaning over its delicate lattice of bindings, adjusting its sympathy alignments with the kind of care I usually reserved for tuning my lute. One wrong move and the whole thing might collapse.  

“Again,” Devi said, her voice like the snap of a bowstring.  

I took a slow breath and steadied myself. Across the room, an old ledger sat closed on another table. Its leather was cracked and worn. It wasn’t important. If I remember right, it had been inspired by some undermerchant’s petty scribblings in Imre. Still, it served its purpose. The book was thick and heavy enough to mimic something far more valuable.  

Devi leaned forward as I activated the device. It made a faint, sighing sound, like an old man turning over in his sleep.  

At first, there was nothing except the low, patient hum of the creation. Devi’s hand flexed against the table while her fingers tapped out a sharp rhythm. “Come on,” she breathed.  

Then, slowly, the blank parchment quivered. Lines began to appear, faint and hesitant, like a ghost rising from a familiar chair. But soon, the words solidified. Letters flowed across the page in thin, uneven strokes, curling and jagged in places but unmistakable in their meaning.  

Devi let out a laugh that broke into something sharper, halfway between triumph and relief. “It worked,” she murmured, leaning over the parchment as though it might vanish if she looked away. Her hand hovered over the page, hesitant, almost reverent. “Kvothe, this is it.”  

I didn’t reply right away. My mind was already racing ahead, searching for flaws. “The range is limited,” I said, even though excitement made my chest tighten. “The replication isn’t clean. The alignment could degrade if the connection isn’t stable.”  

“Hush, Kvothe.” Devi’s grin spread slowly, sharp like a cat stretching. “Do you have to point out every error in the masterpiece we just created? Listen to me carefully. We pulled words out of a book without even touching it. We took hold of something that can’t be seen, darling boy. Let me have this moment before you bury me in your perfectionism.”  

I couldn’t help it. My mouth curved into a smile that felt too sharp to stay on my face. She was right. The idea was beautiful. Even if the result was ugly, it worked. Light and life, it worked. And if it worked here, it would work in the Underthing.

Later, as day slipped quietly into evening, I surfaced. I had not set foot in the Eolian for days. Perhaps weeks. It was getting harder to tell.  

The fresh air did not clear my head the way I had hoped. It caught behind my eyes and drifted away. Still, it sharpened me enough. Enough to put one foot before the other. Enough to lead me toward the place where Sim and Wil would be.  

As usual, they were sitting outside one of the quieter corners of the Eolian, hunched over drinks in chairs that were two misplaced gusts away from collapse. The sight of them gave me that faint thread of relief I hadn’t known I needed.  

“Look who’s emerged,” Wilem said as I slumped into the chair across from them. “And here I thought you’d been locked away by the Masters.”  

“Locked away? Hah.” Sim leaned forward, his grin maddeningly wide. “That’s not it at all. He’s been busy courting a fairy queen in Imre. Or haven’t you heard?”  

It took me half a second too long to realize what they were talking about, and the look on my face immediately set Sim off into laughter. Wilem smothered a grin of his own, taking a deliberate sip from his mug.  

“Devi?” I finally said, forcing my best frown of incredulity. “You honestly think I’m sneaking off to Devi’s room every night for some grand, torrid affair?”  

“Well, you’re certainly sneaking off somewhere,” Sim countered with far too much satisfaction. “And all signs point to Imre. I’m not saying I disapprove, but I’m also not saying I want to know the details. I’m trying to respect her privacy.”  

I groaned and cast a strange look at Wilem, waiting for a rescue. But Wil simply smirked and leaned back in his chair, content to watch me dig my way out of this one.  

“Okay, enough,” I began, but before I could finish, Sim raised a hand solemnly.  

“But you should know,” he went on, quieter this time, “Denna was in town. She came by the Courtyard. She asked about you.”  

The world stilled, as if all the air in Imre had folded itself into that moment. My grin faltered so slightly I doubt they caught it, but Wil’s brow knit almost imperceptibly, a flicker of understanding passing behind his eyes.  

“And?” I said, feigning a lightness that felt like playing a lute with broken strings.  

Sim shifted in his chair. He rubbed the back of his neck in that peculiar way he did when searching for tact.  

“We said we didn’t know where you’d gone,” he murmured, eyes fixed on the floor, as if truth waited somewhere in the cracks. “We might have let her think you’d found company. That you were busy. That sort of busy.”  

He shrugged, small and sheepish. Even his silence seemed to blush.  

“We didn’t mean to,” he added. “But Denna, she has a way of pressing. With her, vague words are only invitations. The more careful your answer, the more questions she asks.”  

They waited expectantly, tension stretching between us like a string being tuned too tight.  

I summoned my charm with deliberate precision, hoping my smile would hold. “You’re not wrong,” I said, the words falling easy and practiced. But I could feel the shadow of my own lie pressing cold against my chest.”  

Sim blinked, open-mouthed. “Wait. You’re saying you?”  

“I’m saying you should give Devi more credit as a companion,” I finished smoothly, sipping from Wil’s neglected mug. “She’s not entirely intolerable company.”  

Sim was too flustered to answer. He looked down, lips pressed tight. As if the words were alive. As if silence could hold them back. Relief passed over his face, light and fleeting. Here, then gone.  

Wil watched him across the table. Silent, careful. For a heartbeat he looked unfamiliar, as if a stranger had taken his place. Someone quizzical. Someone searching. A question hovered in his eyes, half-shaped, unspoken, fading with the soft clatter and low laughter on the patio.  

The conversation moved away. But my thoughts didn’t.  

Denna had been looking for me. Now Sim and Wil, my ever-loyal and well-meaning friends, had ensured she would never try again.  

### * * *

Weeks blurred, bound together by endless nights of fine-tuning the Duplicator and days spent navigating whispers and rumors. Sim and Wilem had grown accustomed to my absences, chalking them up to long nights in Devi’s company. They teased me for my vaulted “romantic escapades,” and I let them believe it. Rumors were safer, a smoke screen that obscured the truth from casual prying.  

Devi and I refined the device gradually, adjusting its reach and precision and adding new functions to make sure it met our ultimate goal. A pantograph-like rig let the device do more than just transfer content, as it also allowed us to copy material at half-scale, which meant we needed less parchment and ink. The device worked not only on open pages and closed books but also on manuscripts locked behind layers of leather and brass, provided we were close enough to create our link.  

At last, when the Duplicator could transcribe from books through both proximity and layers of separation, we took it beneath the University.  

### * * *

The Underthing held its breath as we moved deeper. The narrow corridors and winding tunnels felt different with Devi close, her sharp presence pricking at the fabric of this sacred silence. I felt it like a song played out of tune, the too-loud scrape of her boots jarring against the rhythm of the quiet.  

When Auri walked these halls, the air itself seemed to part for her, soft and giving as water bent around a stone. But with Devi, the walls pressed closer, the shadows feeling less like companions and more like witnesses unsettled by her presence. I hated bringing her here. This wasn’t hers. This was a place of small, fragile trusts, and Auri’s soft, sacred breath echoed in the corners. Devi was a storm where there should only be stillness.  

I justified it because I had no choice. There was no better staging ground than the Underthing for our experiment. No better position to reach the forbidden corners of the Archives. But even as we moved deeper, even as I convinced myself of the necessity, guilt stalked close behind, trailing us through the twisting stone.  

Finally, we found our staging ground in a hollowed-out space where the wall and earth felt thinner and pulsed faintly to those who knew how to listen. Just beyond the Four-Plated Door, we set the device into place and began there.  

At first, it was slow work. The Duplicator was precise but blind. We prodded into the scope of what lay beyond the Four-Plated Door without knowing what we would catch. Each page mirrored came from a book I couldn’t see, a half-glimpse at the world beyond the lock. We catalogued scraps of information, pieced together small fragments of a greater picture.  

And then, one day, the Duplicator whispered a name.  

The document was ornate, the letters formed by firm, deliberate strokes. They bled onto our prepared page with an almost regal sort of weight, the impression far darker than the usual artifacts of ink. Devi’s breath caught audibly beside me, her sharp inhalation echoing slightly against the stone walls.  

“The Order Codex,” she murmured. Her words wrapped around the name like it was a treasure dug up from beneath a thousand years of soil.  

I leaned closer to the parchment, my fingers twitching with instinct. I recognized some of the symbols embedded there, hints of authority and secrecy that spoke of power deliberately hidden. My palms were damp, and my heart beat like a muffled drum in my chest.  

I adjusted the Duplicator’s targeting carefully, narrowing its focus until the next page emerged. My shoulders tensed as I leaned in again, this time finding words I had hoped for and feared at once.  

> “The Amyr.”  

The letters crawled across the page, dragging every suspicion I’d ever harbored into the light. They weren’t just a story, not simply an artifact of bygone lore. Here they were, marked in layered ink and forming a hidden order that was bound and sworn by terrible oaths, cloaked beneath both secrecy and silence.  

My stomach churned as questions made themselves known. Why this knowledge? Why now? Did Lorren protect these books to prevent understanding, or to preserve it for himself? Sudden clarity and doubt hit me all at once, sending my mind tumbling through the possibilities.  

Devi broke through my reverie with a hand pressed firmly against my arm. “Kvothe,” she said quietly, her voice almost reverent despite its usual bite. “We’ve done it.”  

I nodded, the weight of that accomplishment settling over me like a heavy cloak. But this was merely the first thread pulled free. The unraveling had only begun.
