# NOTES

## BOOK 3 PLOT POINTS ADDRESSED

Twenty things stand before, the beginning of book four:

* How Kvothe got to Newarre and became Kote *(see chapter 47/48)*
* Where/what are the Human Amyr and what became of them *(28)*
* What’s in the lockless box *(39)*
* What/Who is behind the doors of stone, and where is it *(39)*
* What’s behind the four-plate door *(8)*
* The demon Kvothe tricks to get his heart’s desire *(8)* and the angel he fights to keep it *(?)*
* Who is princess Ariel *(19)* and how does he rescue her *(45)*
* Who is the king that will be killed and how does he die *(35)*
* What starts the war and who is the penitent king *(31)*
* Who does Kvothe kill in Imre *(47)* (Ambrose)
* Who is Denna’s patron *(38)*
* How Kvothe meets Bast *(18)*
* What do the Chandrian want? *(39)* to elaborate there are several things 1) initially, to destroy all records of themselves (I’m guessing to stop the irritation/pain associated with having their names spoken (Selitos spoke... “May your face be always held in shadow... Your own name will be turned against you, and all who serve you.” I’m guessing but by pledging allegiance to Lanre/Haliax you are then afflicted by the curse), 2) Ultimately they want free of the curse, if Iax can possibly break the curse for them then they are inclined to set him free, Lanre (Haliax) knows Iax is an extremely powerful namer/shaper as he helped imprison him. They need the Loeclos box, more importantly what's inside - this was why they waylaid the tax collectors between Severen and the Lackless estates, and also why they killed Acuelias Lackless, in their attempts to track it down, and why the family originally fractured in order to hide it.
* Where and how does Kvothe acquire the Rings: Stone *(14)*, Wind *(5)*, Amber *(14)*, Wood (WMF from Meluan, doesn’t acquire name), Bone (WMF stapes ring, doesn’t acquire name), Water/Ice *(30)*, Fire (30), Blood *(?)*, Copper *(?)*
* Who is Encanis? – A warped amalgamation of the Chandrian and the Cthaeh, concocted by the Tehlin church to make Tehlu their god.
* Why did the Chandrian wait so long - *(39)* They held out, but after thousands of years of pain, accepted their names will never be forgotten, possibly Cinder was working against them stirring people up to seek out their names in order to force Haliax to work toward breaking the curse instead. Tortured long enough they started searching for a way to set Iax free as a trade to remove the curse, and end Haliax’s immortality.
* Why does Kvothe call Skarpi a rumourmonger - His version of events with regards to Lanre’s past is an Amyr framed version. The Ruarch used mankind as soldiers then after the creation war went back to lording it over them (details kept vague as we have little from this period to go on). Lanre, seeks power and gains it from the Cthaeh, he is also being driven by the Breath of Iax, what I assume is a small part of him that Skindanced in from the Great Beast at the Blac of Drossen Tor, both conspiring to drive him to unite humanity against the Ruarch, continuing Iax's war. Selitos never saw it coming, though the twist will be that it was warranted. Lanre then gets to be the tragic hero, and Skarpi gets to be called a rumourmonger, rather than outright liar, in the frame. The song of seven sorrows is the Chandrian’s attempt to get the truth out after living for centuries listening to The Amyr's confounded version of events.
* What/who is the Cthaeh - Most likely the Tinker mentioned in Hespe’s tale of Jax, however I have left enough room that it could also be Selitos, bound by Tehlu to the iron wheel, punished for his attempts to bring justice before crimes are committed. (This is purely guesswork, and I also imagine the Cthaeh’s fate will come into effect in what would have been books 4 through 6)
* Who betrays Kvothe - The Maer *(35)* and to a lesser extent Denna
* What is the significance of the Lackless Rhyme. *(39)* Seven things stand before The entrance to the Lackless door, One of them a ring unworn (The ring of unearthed standing stones that form the portal), One a word that is forsworn, (Denna made to sing out a phrase to unlock the door, one of the reasons she was being trained by Cinder), One a time that must be right (phase of the moon, has to be a full moon(seems more poetic that way)), One a candle without light (Haliax’s negative light candle which reveals the standing stones that are the Doors of Stone) One a son who brings the blood (Kvothe is a lackless heir his blood opens the Loeclos box), One a door that holds the flood, (the Doors of Stone are the cell doors constructed at Drossen Tor imprisoning Iax and his shaped army, opening them allows Iax and his army to flood out into Temerant) One a thing tight-held in keeping (the Loeclos box), Then comes that which comes with sleeping.(I suspect this involves needing to sleep/dream to open the DoS somehow, maybe passing through Faeriniel, however there isn't enough info to go on, and it is just another impediment to opening the doors, which is the main plot point, so i’ve unfortunately opted to skip it)

## PERCEIVED CHAIN OF EVENTS

**Source:**

* https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1i6vq6c/a_beginning/

**5000 + years ago:**

* The Ruarch exist and some among them can Name
* Iax Lackless(was probably closer to Luckless but we’ll go with Lackless here to make it simpler) becomes a Shaper and creates the Fae
* Iax visits the Lady (She is a version of Ludis from Hespe’s Jax story) from ‘How Old Holly Came To Be’ plays her music, and shows her the art of Shaping, promising to teach her if she returns with him.
* At some stage Humanity, and those of the Fae are shaped/created
* Iax and The Lady marry, and she becomes Lady Lackless/Luckless
* The Old Knowers become angry, thinking Iax and the other Shapers are going too far.
* The Lady confronts Iax over his creations and they fall out, she then leaves and returns to Temerant
* Iax isn't content, perhaps out of fear of reprisal from the Knowers who he considers jealous he desires even more power and speaks to the Cthaeh (likely the Tinker/hermit referenced in Hespe’s story, and not yet bound to the tree by Tehlu)
* On the Cthaeh’s advice Iax tries to pull the moon into the fae
* The attempted theft of the moon sparks the Creation war, with the Old Knowers attacking first
* Iax and the proud dreamers Shape weapons of war, creating creatures such as Durruna, Scrael, Skin Dancers, Draccusi, and Gremmen, and leave the Fae to invade Temerant.
* The Old Knowers start losing, need to increase their numbers, in their desperation they draw humanity into the fight, directing the attacks of Iax onto them
* Lanre and Lyra (likely a Ruarch herself) join the namers/old knowers against Iax and the shapers.
* Iax attacks and destroys cities of the Ergen empire, where the Old Knowers rule hiding as humans
* Iax attacks Belen but is foiled
* Iax is pushed back along the great stone road as Lanre unites humanity against the Shapers
* Humanity and Ruarch push the Shapers into a final confrontation with the plan to imprison Iax and his army within a space constructed in the same manner as the Fae realm.
* Lanre slays Iax’s Great Beast at Drossen Tor, a breath of Iax skin walks into him as he lays dying
* Iax and his remaining forces are defeated at Drossen Tor and shut beyond doors of stone, Lyra and Lady Lackless are key in this.
* Lyra pulls the now Iax corrupted Lanre back from beyond the doors of death, speaking his new name, inadvertently making him immortal, as the rest of Iax is alive trapped behind the DoS, so whenever he dies he is pulled ‘like a lodenstone’ back into the mortal realm.
* The Doors of Stone are buried (sidenote the lackless door/doors of stone is supposedly on the oldest parts of the lackless lands, in old holly she isn't far from her home when the final battle occurs, the location then becomes desolate over time, much like the desert over the other side of the Stormwal.)
* Matters return to as they were before the war with the Ruarch ruling over humanity.
* Lyra leaves Lanre to go on a journey maybe sue for humanities freedom
* Lyra ill,Lyra kidnapped, Lyra died(but no one sure)
* Corrupted Lanre (the enemy moving like a worm in fruit) speaks to Cthaeh to obtain power to bring her back, but he still cannot (I’m thinking it was when Lyra brought Lanre back that his name changed as he is now Hal-iax - the breath of Iax - as the other part of Iax is alive and beyond the DoS he is brought back drawn like iron to a lodenstone, but either at then or at this point, one of them made it so he can no longer sleep, or forget, no solace in madness, or death.)
* unable to reach or resurrect Lyra Lanre blames the Ruach for everything
* Corrupted Lanre (the real Taborlin) convinces 6 other lords/kings, those who had served him during the Creation war, to raise their trusted armies and to destroy the cities of Temerant, and cast out the Ruach
* Selicotos in his anger at this seeming betrayal of a lesser species binds Lanre to shadow, Cursing any who follow him.
* The Angels and the Amyr are formed
* Due to the curse Haliax and the Chandrian feel pain when their names are spoken
* Haliax hopes in time they will be forgotten, only this doesn't happen (perhaps because of Cinder, as he wants to be free of Haliax and cannot until the curse is lifted) and all seems hopeless. (side note maybe Haliax knows their names but they don’t know his.)
* The human Amyr tries to hide the Chandrian’s names, for the greater good, as anyone who finds and speaks their names dies.

**3000 years ago (roughly):**

* The descendants of Lady Lackless, likely of the Yllish branch of the family, who inherited the key to the Doors of Stone, shape a box to hold the key, locking it away to ensure its safety. This is then passed down through the Lackless line for generations.

**3000 years ago to present:**

* Thousands of years pass, and finally Haliax can stand it no longer, their plan is to free Iax in return for ending their suffering. So their purpose becomes to set him free in return for ending the curse, and removing the skinwalker part of Iax from him, so he can become Lanre once more and die.
* Iax is freed, his Alar being greater than Selitos’s, he is able to interrupt it, and thus break the curse. The reason for Haliax’s immortality was that a part of Iax left the body of the great beast when Lanre Slew it and entered him, Iax is able to extricate this part of himself from Haliax reducing him back to Lanre. The stone shattered is left deliberately vague, but is specifically the key originally used to lock the doors of stone, and is not the mountain glass used by Selitos (simpler this way, otherwise there would need to be A key as per the Lackless rhymes and the Mountain Glass coming together at once.)

**Reasoning for the above chain of events:**

I'm paraphrasing, but Shehyn's story mentions, the following key points:

*The Ergen empire had an enemy* - This is unclear at this point, it could be a number of people, possibly Iax, or Haliax, or maybe even the Ctheah.

*The enemy was not strong enough to destroy Taranial* - Lanre succeeds in this which means by process of elimination it is likely Iax being referred to here.

*Moved like a worm in fruit, not of the lethani, poisoned 7 others against the Ergen empire* - Again I'm leaning to Iax manipulating Lanre from within. Iax being the worm, Lanre being the fruit.

Of the names spoken only two are Deep Names I suspect;

Ferule (Cinder) and Alaxel (Haliax) I believe Kvothe does this as one is dead in the frame
(Lanre/Haliax), and the other he wishes to lure to the Waystone (Cinder/Ferule).

This is the big one, what would make those who are already lords or possibly (as stated in both Cyphus’s case) kings amongst their people, trusted according to Shehyn, raise an army and turn on their own cities? This I suspect is the distortion in Skarpi's version of events, the reason he is called a rumourmonger in the frame. They were indeed lords amongst men, but they were ruled by the Ruarch, their possible creators, perhaps even hiding amongst them. Though I doubt it, it's also possible they were all birthed into the world like Menda supposedly was via immaculate conception. These ‘lords and Kings’ along with their armies, which would be Lanre’s former allies and subordinates from the Creation war then turned on them, betraying their Ruarch oppressors, including Selitos.

The reason I say this is simple, each of the Chandrian could have been swayed by the promise of power, they doubtfully however could have convinced whole armies to do so on their behalf, they would have needed a reason to take such a risk.

I'm still of the mind that the 'thing' the Chandrian were originally attempting to do was cast out the Ruarch from Temerant or at least the human occupied territories, who were in large part oppressors of humanity.

With Aleph being the original creator/shaper of man, and thus having sway in how they are treated. We know from Felurian that mankind didn't exist at one stage, so why would they become embroiled in a war with the Shapers unless possibly forced or tricked into it by the Ruarch?

Where Tehlu states: "I will leave this world behind so that I might better serve it, serving you.” This would imply the Ruarch come from another world, and via a means (implied immaculate conception based on Trapis's tale) are able to access Temerant. I wonder if Lanre learnt this. Possibly from Lyra?

Lyra was probably of the Ruarch (see Laniel young again), and sought Aleph's council in order to obtain better conditions for humanity, however the other Ruarch murdered her, so they could retain the status quo. This being the final straw for Lanre who then started the rebellion. Which is referenced here as a betrayal, the idea that a mere human, a lesser race, would oppose them.

## RATIONAL BEHIND CERTAIN PLOT CHOICES

* As Pat doesn't strike me as the sort to write one-dimensional, good-vs-evil characters, it was important to give the Chandrian justification and some form of redemption. This is backed up by Denna’s song, which appears to indicate that the Chandrian, or at least some of them, want to set the historical record straight. They feel slighted.
* Though I agree there is some merit that Denna is a Lackless, ( see https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1pvew4/is_denna_a_lackless_long_post_spoilers/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=KingkillerChronicle&utm_content=t1_e7ityff) I really hope Pat doesn’t opt to go in this direction, and thus ruled it out.
* Lack of resolution regarding the Cthaeh. Kvothe himself says at the beginning this is as much a story of the Chandrian as it is about himself. Given this, and his lack of knowledge on the Cthaeh indicated in WMF, I suspect Pat intends to leave Cthaeh’s fate to the sequels.
* Kvothe is descended from Iax on his mother’s side, again I hope there isnt any any substance around Iax somehow raping Laurian/Netalia from beyond the Doors of Stone. It would get really messy if the plot goes in that direction. Also the text clearly implies Kvothe resembles both Laurian and Arliden. Mother's eyes. Father's hands and voice.
* What's in the box; I like Zhorangi’s theory Auri is in the Waystone, and maybe in the box, but it's really hard to write that in a way that doesn't come off as stupid. So went with the implication that he may have retrieved a part of himself and his shaed which has now healed.

## ELEMENTS I CONSIDERED CHANGING

* This one only came to recently and I would change it if I wasn't so near completion, inside the Lackless box is the moonshard used to bind the moon to the Fae realm, this is said to be Iax/Jax’s greatest desire, Haliax bargains it to Iax in return for freeing him from life.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/le2ucq/severen_is_located_where_myr_tyraniel_used_to_be/ This thread makes a great case for Severen being Myr Taraniel and the seat of original power for the Amyr possibly, could have had Dagon reveal the human chapter are within Severen still, Instead of having him ride slightly further out to the Leveritis.
* Considered having two stones in the Loeclos box the other being the mountain glass used to curse Lanre, but just didn't feel right or really add anything
* Could have done with another scene, just Bast and Kvothe, to help build the Camaraderie. Considered having them venturing out in Vintas alone together, maybe some locals picking a fight with them, where Bast gets to see another side of K and he teaches him something.
* I subscribe to the theory Auri’s in the thrice locked chest and it's a portal of some kind, but I couldn't think of a way to write it that didn't come off as a bit weird.
* No visit to Junpui, although PR has indicated this will be in DoS.
* I love the theory of Bredon being Aculeus Lackless and not Cinder, and think it would make a great twist especially if Kvothe kills him when he was only trying to aid him in secret, and is after the same people he is, perhaps is a Modegan Rider? however I couldn't then think of a suitable way/twist to reveal the Chandrian at the end.
* I considered having the final battle be the 6 remaining Chandrian versus Kvothe's allies hiding in Newarre, Elodin masquerading as the priest, martyn as crazy Martin, Auri, maybe keep will and sim alive, Devi, and Fela, and this would have been cool, but also really messy, and would have taken away from Kvothe's rivalry with Cinder.
* These aspects of the girls and boys version of the lackless rhyme are purposefully ignored, 'She's been dreaming and not sleeping. On a road, that's not for travelling. Lackless likes her riddle raveling' and 'Then comes that which comes with sleeping'. As theorised by some this likely relates to travelling through Faerinial after the DoS are opened, however I suspect they don't alter the final conclusion, and as there is so little information covering them, I've opted to skip them.
* Toyed with Kvothe calling Denna back from beyond the doors of death at the end, then having to fight and kill one of the ruach, and then Denna escapes in the night, but no way would he be waiting in the Inn if this were the case, so I opted to leave it.
* For an added twist I considered having Cinder allude to the Chandrian not being responsible for killing Kvothe's troupe, but decided against it. https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/10hw76y/were_some_of_kvothes_troupe_killed_using_arrows/
* Considered having Elodin be Abbe Leodin but there are two reasons why they aren't the same person; Kvothe says he buried the Scrael wrong, and Elodin taught chronicler after Kvothe left which means he's likely still at the uni. From a story point of view his presence just gets in the way. Also as previously mentioned this would rob Kvothe of some of his agency in the final confrontation.
* I originally considered adding a key to the Loeclos box to be in the archive, the Chandrian then make an appearance to claim it with a huge set piece ensuing, but It was hard to conceive of a scenario that would make that work.
* Would have loved to include more of Denna’s backstory, her relationship to Yll and who is chasing her that makes her keep moving on, but there just isn't enough there, without inventing whole new sections, which is against the remit for this fan edition.
* File this under doubtful but possible - Is Cinder to Haliax the equivalent of Bast to Kvothe, attempting to manipulate the Chandrian into action. Maybe originally Haliax wanted for the Chandrian to be forgotten by time, but now Cinder acts as a Patron to people (Arliden perhaps, and Denna very likely) to get them find and call their names, until Haliax has to accept they cannot hide, and need to break the curse.
* In another completely different direction, what if Kvothe pledged allegiance to Haliax for some reason? This would explain why he changed his name and created the thrice locked chest to seal it away. Perhaps the original High King of Modeg was the ‘one who remembered the lethani’ and locked his name away so that Haliax couldn’t speak it and cause him pain like he does Cinder, exerting control over him. Question is; why would Kvothe pledge allegiance to Haliax? Perhaps forced to do so in order save someone, this creates other problems as well though, why free Iax before the frame if not to clear the curse? In this version by swearing allegiance he too would become one of the Chandrian, and his sign would be silence.
* Scene between Kvothe and Fela when he returns to Imre after Sim’s death.
* Scene with Manet when he takes up the Master’s chair.
* Scene near the end before nightfall and Cinder arrives where Kote shaves, maybe add a line about it being proper to be clean shaven in some cultures before death.

## ALTERNATE ENDINGS

* All the Chandrian come to the Waystone, but Kvothe has more help waiting in secret, i.e. Elodin, Auri, Devi possibly ect.
* In his battle with Cinder, Kvothe blows a horn in the Fae which summons the Scythe who in turn take Cinder.
* Same as above, but Cinder reveals the Chandrian acted based on what the Ctheah told them, Kvothe then goes and burns down the Ctheah, with the audience left to wonder if this was what the Ctheah wanted all along. - This ending has the added benefit of closing out the entire story, rather than leaving it open-ended.
