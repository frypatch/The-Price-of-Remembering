# CHAPTER 32.

## THE FALL.


THE WIND WRITHED around me, humming a note I could almost taste. It was everywhere–pushing my hair, stinging my eyes, filling the space between my ribs and the stone wall I clung to. With it came the pull of an impossible thought: *Let go. Trust it. Let it take you, as it took Taborlin.* I considered it for half a heartbeat, but every inch of my body screamed in defiance. A story is fine for Taborlin the Great, but I wasn’t great. Not yet.

Auri clung to my back, fragile but steady. “You won’t,” she whispered. She said it so softly, like the wind wouldn’t hear. “You’ll hold on.”

I shifted my focus, forcing myself to see the stones beneath my fingers, broad and ancient. I felt their cold weight as the wind roared indignantly, demanding my attention. Then, as clear as my own name, I felt it: not one stone, but three. I reached for the name that bound them, and something inside me shifted. As I spoke, the tension in the rock eased, and the block beneath my toes pushed itself forward.

A step.

Each time, the act pressed the edge of my mind, my focus wavering like a lantern in the wind, but it worked. Another stone shunted out. Then another. I crawled downward in agonizing slowness, my hands raw and trembling. Below us, a balcony yawned open like an escape. Relief sank its claws into my chest as I dropped lightly onto the smooth, slick surface.

Through the open balcony doors, an empty chamber stretched before us. Stone floors polished by centuries of footsteps reflected the light of an iron chandelier, its candles burning low. A long oak table sat at the center like the spine of the room. I let Auri’s feet touch the ground and grabbed her hand. “Come on,” I said, moving fast. The sound of boots echoed faintly above us.

The first door was locked. The second opened a pitiful inch before a sharp grind told me its bolt was in place. The third swung open just as four knights spilled into the room, swords drawn. I pulled Auri close, pressing her against me as the knights fanned out. A man in a captain’s sash barked an order: “Hold!” His eyes darted between me, the broken window, and Auri. He was putting the story together in fragments.

“Trust me,” I murmured into her ear. Then, quick as a Magician’s flourish, I pulled a knife from my boot and pressed it against her throat. “Stay back!” I shouted, my voice lashing through the room.

Auri yelped. Trembling ever so slightly, she said, “He’ll do it. He’ll kill me!”

The captain froze, his hand tightening on the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword. “Easy,” he said carefully. “No one has to get hurt.”

“Over there,” I hissed, motioning with the knife. “All of you. To the far wall.” 

The steel-clad soldiers obeyed, their boots grinding across the grout. They stopped only when their backs touched cold stone. My knife still at Auri’s throat, I maneuvered us toward the door they had entered, my pulse hammering in my ears. Three paces from the door, I heard new steps. Measured and deliberate. Then came the King.

Roderick entered, his chest heaving, his crimson cloak trailing behind him. Baron Jakis hovered to his right, pale and stiff, flanked by two of his house guards. The sight of royalty would normally freeze me, but I was too close to breaking. Too close to failure. And behind Roderick, more armored men poured into the room, lining the walls like wolves stalking prey.

“Unhand her!” Roderick spat, his voice trembling like a taut bowstring. “If a single hair is harmed, I will have you carved into pieces and fed to the crows.”

“You’ve left me no choices, Your Majesty.” My words were quick and desperate, angling instead of striking. My grip tightened. “Your city isn’t safe. Your court isn’t safe.”

“I’ve heard enough of your conspiracies!” Roderick hissed, but then hesitated.

I dug deeper into the air between us. “Ask Jakis,” I said, my voice calm and deliberate. “Ask him about the army.”

“What—” The King’s eyes cut to the Baron. “You would swear to me, Vito?”

“If this sorry liar had seen an army,” Jakis said steadily, though he shifted just slightly on his feet, “he'd be dead already. He’s scrambling for lies to save his own skin.”

“Send scouts then,” I countered sharply. “Let them sally forth and finally see with their own hungry eyes.”

Before Roderick could reply, Fascino Regent appeared at the room’s edge, his stride unhurried, his detachment of guards surrounding him like vipers. And unlike Jakis, he smiled.

“Fascino,” the King began, though there was a tremor now to his words. “What treason turns this tide?”

Fascino shrugged. “Oh, it’s quite true. Jakis brought his little forces. Mine never left.”

Roderick turned red, then white. “You… After all I’ve—”

Fascino waved him off lazily. “Spare us the lamentations, Roderick.” Then, darkly, “You ruled with song when the world demanded flame.”

The sound that came next broke the air in two. Screams. Clanging echoes of metal below. Roderick shouted something, but it was lost as Fascino’s men drew their weapons. His words had barely faded before swords clashed in fury, blood splashing mute black over pale stone. 

“You! Move!” I snarled at Roderick, dragging him and Auri toward the door as chaos chewed at the chamber. “Which way?” I demanded without looking back.

“North,” Auri said, pulling at my sleeve. “The Tower of Tears.”

Roderick, his breathing ragged, blinked and then nodded. “That way!” He stumbled forward, leading us left.

We ran. A small mercy that the halls were clear, the only sound the echo of our frantic steps. Remembering the plan, I fumbled in my pocket for the sticks to signal the otheres that everything had well and truly gone to hell.

“Kvothe!” Auri’s small cry caught me. I looked back to see them—a dozen knights, Fascino’s sigil bright on their chests, turning the corner less than forty feet behind us.

I stopped without thinking, planting myself between them and the others. “Keep going!” I shouted over my shoulder. “Get to the tower!”

“Kvothe, no!” Auri’s voice broke, but Roderick grabbed her, pulling her onward.

I turned to the enemy. I may have looked pitiful—no armor, an arrow quivering from my shoulder—but power roared beneath my skin. When I called the Name of the Wind, the walls seemed to tighten in fear.

It ripped forward like vengeance, howling. Curtains tore free, slicing through the soldiers with their rusted iron rods. One screamed as he flew backward, smashing into the wall. Another tumbled through the shattering window, his armored body plummeting into the chaos below. 

But not all of them fell. The second rank knelt, crossbows ready. I saw the bolt too late. It struck my left shoulder, shoving me back against the wall. Pain shot through me like a jagged crevice, but still, I drew myself forward, spilling my Alar wide enough to hold them rooted.

Steel flashed, and the third crossbowman crumpled, gurgling as Sim retracted a blade from his chest. Wil stepped forward, axe in hand, eyes sharp. “Charred body of Tehlu, I thought you'd be dead by now.”

“So did I,” I croaked, clutching my shoulder.

“Denna’s waiting at the gate,” Sim said, already hauling me upright. “Let’s end this.”

But as the screaming continued above us, I turned toward the Tower. “Not without them.” And with a crash of steel behind us, we ran into what remained.
