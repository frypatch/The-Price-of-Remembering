# CHAPTER 32.

## THE FALL.


THE WIND WRITHED around me, humming a note I could almost taste. It was everywhere, pushing my hair, stinging my eyes, filling the space between my ribs and the stone wall I clung to. With it came the pull of an impossible thought. Let go, trust it, let it take you as it took Taborlin.  

I considered it for half a heartbeat, but every inch of my body screamed in defiance. Such stories suited Taborlin the Great. But I was not great. Not yet.  

Auri clung to my back, a slender bird made of secrets and moonlight. "No," she whispered softly, pressing her cheek against my shoulder. "The stones won’t let you fall. They remember how to hold hands."  

I shifted my focus, forcing myself to see the stones beneath my fingers, broad and ancient. I felt their cold weight as the wind roared indignantly, demanding my attention. Then, as clear as my own name, I sensed it, not one stone but three. I reached for the name that bound them. Something inside me shifted. When I spoke, the tension in the rock eased, and the block beneath my toes pushed itself forward.  

A step.  

I tried again, the effort pressing against the edge of my mind, my focus flickering like a lantern caught in a storm. But it worked. Another stone eased forward. Then another. I crawled downward with agonizing slowness, my hands raw and trembling. Below, a balcony yawned open, a welcome escape. Relief sank its claws into my chest as I finally dropped onto its smooth, slick surface.  

Each time, the act pressed the edge of my mind, my focus wavering like a lantern in the wind, but it worked. Another stone shunted out. Then another. I crawled downward in agonizing slowness, my hands raw and trembling. Below us, a balcony yawned open like an escape. Relief sank its claws into my chest as I dropped lightly onto the smooth, slick surface.  

Through the open balcony doors an empty chamber stretched ahead. Stone floors polished by centuries of footsteps reflected the glow of an iron chandelier, its candles burning low. A long oak table stood at the center like the spine of the room. I lowered Auri gently, grasping her hand. “Come on,” I said, moving quickly. The sound of boots echoed faintly above us.  

The first door was locked. The second opened a pitiful inch before the scrape of metal announced its bolt still held. The third swung wide just as four knights spilled into the room, swords drawn. I pulled Auri close, pressing her against me as the knights fanned outward. A man wearing a captain’s sash barked an order. “Hold!” His eyes darted between me, the broken window, and Auri. He was piecing the story together in fragments.  

“Trust me,” I murmured into her ear. Then, quick as a magician’s flourish, I drew a knife from my boot and pressed it to her throat. “Stay back!” I shouted, my voice lashing through the room.  

Auri gave a small, frightened gasp, trembling like a leaf caught in wind. "Oh, please," she whispered, eyes wide and glass-bright. "He’ll cut the moon right out of me."  

The captain froze, his hand tightening around the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword. “Easy,” he said carefully. “No one has to get hurt.”  

“Over there,” I hissed, motioning with the knife. “All of you, to the far wall.”  

The steel-clad soldiers obeyed, their boots scraping across grout until their backs touched cold stone. With my knife still held against Auri’s throat, I maneuvered us toward the door they had entered, my pulse hammering in my ears. Three paces from escape, I heard new footsteps, measured and deliberate.  

Roderick entered, his chest heaving, crimson cloak trailing behind him. Baron Jakis hovered at his right, pale and stiff, flanked by two of his guards. Normally, royalty might freeze me in place. But I was too close to breaking, too close to failure. Behind Roderick, more armored men poured into the room, lining the walls like wolves stalking prey.  

“Unhand her!” Roderick spat, his voice trembling like a taut bowstring. “If a single hair is harmed, I will have you carved into pieces and fed to the crows.”  

“You’ve left me no choices, Your Majesty.” My words came quick and desperate, angling instead of striking. My grip tightened. “Your city isn’t safe. Your court isn’t safe.”  

“I’ve heard enough of your conspiracies!” Roderick hissed, but then he hesitated.  

I pressed deeper into the silence between us. “Ask Jakis,” I said calmly. “Ask him about the army.”  

“What?” The King’s eyes cut to the Baron. “You would swear to me, Vito?”  

“If this sorry liar had seen an army,” Jakis said steadily, though he shifted slightly on his feet, “he would be dead already. He scrambles for lies to save his own skin.”  

“Send scouts then,” I countered sharply. “Let them sally forth and finally see with their own hungry eyes.”  

Before Roderick could reply, Fascino Regent appeared at the edge of the room. His stride was unhurried, his detachment of guards surrounding him like vipers. Unlike Jakis, Fascino smiled.  

“Fascino.” The King’s voice shook with fury and wounded pride. “What madness is this? You would betray me, after everything?”  

Fascino gave a cold smile, meeting the King’s eyes without fear. “Madness? No, Roderick. Only clarity. Jakis brought his little forces, but mine never truly left.”  

Roderick turned red, then white. “You! After all I’ve—”  

Fascino waved him off lazily. “Spare us the lamentations, Roderick.” He spoke darkly now. “You ruled with song when the world demanded flame.”  

The sound that followed broke the air in two. Screams rose, metal clanging sharply below. Roderick shouted something, but his words were lost as Fascino’s men drew their weapons. Blades flashed. Swords clashed with fury, blood spilling mute and black across pale stone.  

“You! Move!” I snarled at Roderick, dragging him and Auri toward the door as chaos devoured the chamber. “Which way?” I demanded without looking back.  

“North,” Auri said, pulling at my sleeve. “The Tower of Tears.”  

Roderick blinked, his breathing ragged, and nodded. “That way.” He stumbled forward, leading us left.  

We ran. It was a small mercy that the halls were clear. The only sound was our frantic footfalls echoing off stone. Remembering the plan, I fumbled in my pocket for the sticks that would signal the others that everything had truly gone to hell.  

“Kvothe!” Auri’s small cry caught me. I looked back to see them, a dozen knights with Fascino’s sigil bright on their chests, rounding the corner less than forty feet behind us.  

I stopped without thought, planting myself between them and the others. “Keep going!” I shouted over my shoulder. “Get to the tower!”  

“Kvothe, no!” Auri’s voice broke, but Roderick grabbed her, pulling her onward.  

I turned to face the enemy. Perhaps I looked pitiful, no armor and an arrow quivering from my shoulder, but power roared beneath my skin. When I called the Name of the Wind, the walls seemed to tighten in fear.  

It ripped forward like vengeance, howling. Curtains tore free, slicing through soldiers with rusted iron rods. One screamed as he flew backward and smashed into the wall. Another tumbled through the shattered window, armored body plummeting to the chaos below.  

But not all of them fell. The second rank knelt, crossbows at the ready. I saw the bolt too late. It punched into my left shoulder and pinned me back against the wall. Pain shot through me like lightning through a jagged crevice. Still I drew myself forward, spilling my Alar wide enough to hold them rooted.  

Steel flashed, and the third bowman crumpled, gurgling as Sim retracted his blade from the man’s chest. Wil stepped forward, axe in hand, eyes sharp. “Charred body of Tehlu, I thought you would be dead by now.”  

“So did I,” I croaked, clutching my shoulder.  

“Denna’s waiting at the gate,” Sim said, already hauling me upright. “Let’s end this.”  

But as the screaming continued above us, I turned toward the Tower. “Not without them.” With steel crashing at our backs, we ran toward what remained.
