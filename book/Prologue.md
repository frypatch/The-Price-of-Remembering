## A SILENCS OF THREE PARTS

IT WAS NIGHT IN Newarre, and the Waystone Inn lay in silence, a silence of three parts.  

The first was an absence, hollow and wide. Doors stayed shut. Windows slept dark. No crackle of kindling stirred hearths, no footsteps brushed dew from the grass. If there had been music—but no, there was no music. The silence lingered heavy, caught in the spaces where life might once have been.  

In the inn’s basement, the second silence curled sharp and anxious. Coals in a small forge glowed faintly, their heat fading into whispers of orange light. Tools lay scattered on a workbench: tongs tipped with blackened soot, a copper chisel tarnished green. Nearby, acid hissed on the stone where it had spilled, its quiet persistence adding tension to the stillness. This wasn't peace. This was the silence of effort begun and abandoned.  

The third silence wrapped around the inn itself, deep and unyielding. It was in the locks turned tight, in the timbers that groaned faintly in the cool of the night. It belonged, most of all, to the man upstairs. He undressed by the dim light of a single candle, moving slowly, as if nursing wounds unseen. His hair, a bright red that once caught firelight, was dull in the darkness. His hands trembled faintly as he folded his shirt, each motion deliberate. His eyes, dark with some great weight, moved restlessly but saw nothing.  

This silence was his. He carried it like an old wound, deep and wide and inescapable. It was not the quiet of rest or relief but something heavy, brittle at the edges, ready to shatter. It was the silence of a man who had forgotten his song. It was the silence of someone waiting—waiting for time, for change, for an ending.  

And so the Waystone lay still. The silence waited with him.
