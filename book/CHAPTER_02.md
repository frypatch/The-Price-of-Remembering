# CHAPTER 2.

## THE FRAGILE WEIGHT OF PEACE.


FOR THE FIRST TIME since the road swallowed my family and spat me into its dust, I found peace. Not the brittle kind that vanishes with the slightest breath, but something richer and heavier. The Maer’s coin had loosened the tight, strangling fingers of debt around my throat. My deal with Riem had let me breathe easier still. Together, they made the world feel almost manageable.  

This is what peace looked like. Mornings heavy with the scent of ink and parchment. Afternoons caught in tangled chords and experimental rhythms. Evenings thick with honey-gold light and silken laughter. I studied. I played music that made the heart rise and falter. I charmed women whose fire matched my own. Time felt like water cupped in my hands, precious and fleeting.  

But I was young, and youth burns like kindling. It does not plan nor ask questions. I thought myself clever, brilliant even. I believed I could shape the world to my will, one turn of brass and one twist of wire at a time. And that unbridled confidence, as with so many stories, is how *The Stainless* was born.  

### * * *

It was summer, and Kilvin's workshop buzzed like a hive. Gears ticked, water bubbled, and the air swam with the tang of hot copper and grease. I was hunched over a delicate spring mechanism at my station, sweat beading on my neck. My fingers toyed with a coil of tempered brass, its bright sheen mocking me with each brittle snap.   

“If I could,” I muttered, then caught myself. My lips pursed as if that would hold back the frustrated edge in my voice. My hands shifted to my notebook, and I scrawled some furious notes across the page.  

> “Deflect the force. Don't resist or break it.”  
> “Bend just enough, like a reed.”  
> “It snaps back, how to temper its force?”  
> “Needs better attachment. Wears out too fast.”  

For hours, I chased the idea around in circles. My peers came and went. They dipped iron rods in oil and muttered Alar to stubbornly glowing lamps. They marveled at the mechanisms that failed on my table, but no one lingered, and I preferred it that way.  

It took weeks, the kind of weeks that dissolve all thought of food or rest. But when the idea finally clicked, it sang through me. *The Stainless.* The device consisted of an elegant coil combined with a tempered brass surface that bent to punishment. Then, a collection of garnets smoothed the gears that safely metered back the resulting force.  

Its purpose? Nothing profound. Just to endure.  

It became a small wonder at the University. Students tested its limits with glee, finding it all but unbreakable. My first demonstration of it drew a dry laugh from Kilvin as he watched it with what I mistook for simple fondness. But when the laughter faded, he turned the small contraption over in his hands, inspecting every detail with those thick, deliberate fingers of his.  

“It is beautiful, Kvothe,” Kilvin said in a calming tone. “But beauty is never untangled from its costs.”  

I stiffened, confused. “Costs, Master Kilvin? It’s harmless. It can’t hurt anyone. It’s just a demonstration of resilience.”  

Kilvin shifted his gaze to me, his eyes shadowed beneath his heavy brow. “Harmless?” he said softly, his thumb brushing the polished brass. “Resilience is strength, strength is power, and power rarely keeps to itself.”  

Before I could defend myself, he continued, “You are too quick, Re’lar Kvothe. Quick to make and quicker to solve,” he said. “But wisdom is slow to grow. Always slower than the fire of cleverness.”  

I wanted to snap back, but the weight of his words landed where I did not expect. My chest, my stomach, my hands. I felt Kilvin’s gaze press into me when I left the workshop with *The Stainless* tucked under one arm. Its polished surface was cool and smooth against my skin, yet strangely heavy on my heart.

That weight followed me into the Archives the next morning. The stillness there always brought a kind of solace, the light filtering through narrow windows soft as a secret. That day, I sat with Chancellor Herma at a wide table littered with Yllish knots. Their cords curled like spilled ink over the desk, beautiful and beguiling.  

Herma’s hands trembled as they worked the rope, his fingers brushing over a tangle of knots like they were alive and needing soothing. The tremor was small at first, a faint note in the symphony of the quiet room.  

Then, *snap*.  

The knot came undone, loose fibers unwinding with a sharp finality. Herma’s breath hitched, and his shoulders tightened. The strands in his hands lay limp as dead snakes.  

“Master?” I stood, suddenly aware of the stillness my own movement disturbed. “Should I summon someone from the Medica?”  

Herma lifted a slow, deliberate hand, as if turning away a tide. “No,” he said, his voice quiet but resolute. He drew a deeper breath  and let his fingers rest against the limp cords. It was a gesture of comfort, meant perhaps for them, but more likely for himself.  

“These little betrayals,” he said after a moment, his usual steady baritone only slightly rough, “are nothing new, Kvothe. A bit like old friends who overstay their welcome. Bitter draughts and black poultices are our ways of shaking hands.”  

I frowned. My mouth wanted to smile. My heart wanted to flinch. Was that a weak attempt at humor or his hurt laid bare by accident? “Perhaps if you—”  

Herma cut me off, his voice growing firmer though his smile remained. “Kvothe, there’s nothing to fuss over. I am as I need to be. Some knots slip. The world keeps spinning.”  

He leaned back then, his gray eyes catching the light like polished stones, and said something softer. “Who would have guessed, all those years ago? The stubborn boy sitting before me, sharp as flint, proud as a crow. Who could have known he would be unraveling knots alongside me one day?”  

The humor in his voice felt warm, but I heard something beneath it. A trace of wistfulness. Of finality.  

I forced myself to smile. My shoulders shrugged as if to shed the moment’s weight. “Good friends and teachers make all the difference,” I said. “I am proof enough of that.”  

Herma nodded slowly, a touch of pride softening his expression. “And good knots,” he muttered, drumming his fingers over the failed rope, “are worth the effort, too.”  

The moment passed, leaving only the faint creak of his chair as he turned back to the tangled cords.  

### * * *

Hours later, as I slid the last book back into its slot on the Archive shelves, I allowed myself a moment to breathe. The day was quiet, save for the faint rustling of pages and the occasional murmur from students shuffling between aisles. Yet a weight lingered at the outer edges of things, the kind no sunlight could dispel.  

I shouldn’t have ignored it.  

As I left the Archives, the afternoon breeze did little to shake the knot nudging restlessly at the back of my mind. Questions murmured there in whispers too dim to parse. Chancellor Herma might have dismissed his tremors, but a man steady as stone doesn’t crack without reason.  

The world rarely grants peace without a cost. And even then, the toll is never paid up front but instead settles on you slowly, like ash after a far-off fire.
