# CHAPTER 17

## OF DANCING STONES  

THE FROST THAT painted the edges of windows and cobblestones seemed like quiet promises, each filigree curling into itself, delicate and doomed. It gripped at the world like it might shatter under the weight of the next breath—and in this, it mirrored me. The air was thin beneath the stars, the night thick with a kind of silence that made it easy to believe I was the only soul left breathing.

The road ahead was little more than a gray scar stretching into the night. The lantern I’d borrowed from Anker hung heavy in my hand, its light carving a small, uncertain circle in the darkness. Above, the stars blinked faintly, smeared across the sky like chalk, their pale light offering nothing but a vague sense of distance.  

Renere seemed impossibly far, its name a faint murmur in the back of my mind, soft and slippery with doubt. Somewhere ahead of me, Ambrose lived and breathed. And somewhere beyond even his reach, Auri waited—or didn’t. Thoughts of her drifted close, insistent and bright, like moths brushing a candle flame. But I couldn’t afford to think of Auri. Not yet.  

I kept walking, each step on the uneven dirt road was a small rebellion against common sense—and better footwear. My boots were borrowed, and they let me know it constantly, gnawing at my heels like an insult I couldn’t shake. If my feet bled, at least they had the decency to match the rest of me.

That’s when I saw them. Figures on the horizon, gray shapes surfacing against the dark. My first thought was a trick of the lantern, its erratic light twisting shadows into men. My second thought was more immediate, more solid: I was in danger. But before I could step away, one of them called out.

“Still warm,” It was Wil’s voice, sharp and cutting as his silhouette came into focus. “Better fix that.”

The fist came quick and crooked, a punch full of fury that smashed into my jaw before I could breathe his name. My vision cracked wide as the taste of plum and nutmeg burst bright and bitter in my mouth. For a moment, I swayed, swamped by dizziness, my limbs flailing like a sapling bent too far in the wind.

Anger rushed in hot, as sharp-edged as Wil’s knuckles. My fists clenched on instinct as I took a step forward, but before I could move, Simmon slipped between us. His hand caught Wil’s wrist midair—firm enough to restrain, loose enough to let go.

“Damn the both of you,” Sim said, his voice strained not by volume but by weight. His body was trembling, whether from anger or the cold I couldn’t tell.

Wil looked away, breathing hard, though the fire hadn’t completely left him. When Sim was certain we wouldn’t lunge at one another again, he stepped back and turned to face us both.  

“You are right to be angry,” Sim told Wil. “I don’t condone what he’s done either. But black hands, Wil—when I told you he was safe, I saw the look on your face. You were relieved. Don’t act like you don’t care.”  

Wil met his glance but said nothing, his jaw clenched hard enough to snap bone. When it was clear Sim would neither budge nor bark, Wil pulled back, but the anger in his eyes smoldered still, banked but not extinguished.  

Sim watched him retreat, then turned to me, his face caught halfway between worry and disappointment. “Kvothe,” he started. My name fell soft, like a pebble into water, rippling outward.  

I raised a hand, stopping him. My voice crawled up my throat to meet the suffocating silence. “If I could have saved Lorren, I would have.” The words cracked in the cold air. Shame tightened around my chest and lodged in my tongue as I added, “If I…” I couldn’t finish.  

Wil’s expression barely shifted. His anger carved lines across his face, but his tone grew colder when he finally spoke. “It’s not just Lorren, Kvothe. It’s the Archives. You put generations of reputation at risk of being tainted, and for what? Your curiosity?” He spat the word like it burned to even hold it in his mouth.  

“It wasn’t just that,” I said, defensive without meaning to be. But how could I explain the weight of what I’d found, the truths I had only begun to uncover? They wouldn’t believe me. Tehlu help me, even if I told them they wouldn’t believe.  

“Then explain it,” Wilem said, his voice brittle and low. “You can’t keep everything buried. Not this. Not anymore.”  

“You owe us the truth,” Sim added gently, though his gaze was firm. “After everything, tell us.”  

I breathed out, heavy and slow, as if exhaling might purge the shame lodged in my ribs. I opened my mouth to argue, to deflect, but stopped. They were right. More than that, they deserved it. So I let the fight drain out of me, shoulders slumped under the weight of my words.  

“You’d better get comfortable,” I muttered darkly, the words trying and failing to carry humor.  

Sim gestured down the road. “Tell us on the way.”  

I blinked. “You’re coming with me?”  

“Of course we are,” Sim said, incredulous. “Do you think we’d let you do this alone?”  

Wilem nodded, his hand darting out to pull me upright with a strength that was startling. “You’re an idiot, but you’re our idiot.”  

Something warm and messy knotted itself in my chest. I turned away quickly, shielding my expression from their eyes. “You know I'm going to Renere, right?”  

Sim smiled faintly. “And Ambrose,” he said. “I figured that much out.”  

“Then you know this ends poorly,” I managed, biting back a choke of laughter that bordered on tears.  

“We’ve stuck beside you through worse,” Sim said, patting me on the shoulder. “We’re your friends, Kvothe. Stop being so surprised by it.”  

With that, the road ahead suddenly felt lighter—not shorter, but lighter all the same.  

### * * *

A few hours later, we caught a ride with a passing fetter cart. Sitting in the back, we jostled along the uneven road, our silence broken only by the rhythmic creak of wood and the occasional grunt of the old farmer at the reins.  

It was there, as the dust rose in lazy wisps behind us, that I finally cracked the wall I’d held between them and the truth. I shared everything—the life of my parents on the road with the Edema Ruh, their murder, and the awful, shivering truth of the Chandrian. They didn’t interrupt. Wilem sat still, his dark, thoughtful eyes pinned on a spot somewhere on the horizon. Sim stared down at his feet, as if unable to meet my gaze.  

When I finished, it was as if I’d drawn something poisonous from my chest. Teccam once wrote about such things, the way confessions could lessen the weight of pain. Some of that poison was gone now.  

Not all of it. Wil’s skepticism was briefly hidden, but as the air quieted, I caught the faint flicker of doubt shared between him and Sim. I said nothing about it—what was the point?  

I shifted focus instead, drawing on my growing skill with Naming. They watched in quiet fascination as I called a ring of stone into being. I slipped into onto my finger beside and the simple amber one Auri had given me.  

“Rings like these,” I murmured, flexing my fingers, “are meant to give my enemies pause.”  

“Or make them laugh,” Sim quipped with his customary optimism.  

Wilem just shook his head. “You’ll draw attention, good or bad. That armor cuts both ways.”  

We all knew he was right.  

### * * *

It was Wil who saw them, his sharp eyes catching the circle of greystones on a bluff ahead. He gestured, drawing our attention to the ancient monoliths. We bid goodbye to the farmer and made our way toward them.  

Standing beneath the stones, I couldn’t help but feel their quiet power. They stood like giants too tired to move, their surfaces worn smooth by the slow fingers of time. I was reminded of a passage I’d read in *En Temerant Voistra*, whispering about their use as gates to the Fae. That memory had barely surfaced before I rushed to retrieve the book from my travel sack. Wil, Sim, and I pawed through it under the afternoon light.  

By moonlight, we finally made progress. Wilem was the better scholar of us by far, his patience and proficiency with Temic outmatching my rushed translations. But even he stumbled on one word, pausing.  

“Dance?” he murmured with disbelief, scratching his head.  

“Dance?” Sim scoffed.  

But I said nothing. Denna’s voice stirred in memory, her question rising like warmth: *Do you know the secrets of stones?* I placed my hands on the nearest surface and leaned into the hum.  

The Name didn’t come as a sound but a shape. Soft at first, round at the edges. Then sharp. The weight of it spread out, vast yet contained, pressing back against me like the tide. When it came whole, it left my lips before I could stop myself: *“Cyaerbasalien.”*  

The stones shifted beneath my hand as the Name took root, a low tremor rippling through the circle. The world paused for a breath, then stilled.  

“It didn’t work,” I began, frustration threatening to surface—  

Until Sim’s sudden touch on my shoulder stopped me. “Kvothe, look,” he whispered, pointing to the sky.  

I followed his gaze. The stars above were wrong. They drifted in unfamiliar patterns, trembling faintly, as if unsure whether they belonged. The air clung thick and sweet around us, like the memory of distant music.  

We had crossed into the Fae.
