# CHAPTER 17.

## OF DANCING STONES.


THE FROST THAT PAINTED the edges of windows and cobblestones seemed like quiet promises, each finger curling into itself, delicate and doomed. It gripped at the world as if it might shatter under the weight of the next breath. In this way, it mirrored me. The air was thin beneath the stars, and the night was thick with a kind of silence that made it easy to believe I was the only soul left breathing.

The road ahead was little more than a gray scar stretching into the night. The lantern I’d borrowed from Anker hung heavy in my hand, its light carving a small, uncertain circle in the darkness. Above, the stars blinked faintly, smeared across the sky like chalk, their pale light offering nothing but a vague sense of distance.

Renere seemed impossibly far. Its name echoed quietly in the back of my mind, soft and slippery with doubt. Somewhere ahead, Ambrose pressed onward, and Auri was dragged along with him. To what end, I did not dare imagine. Thoughts of her drifted close, insistent and bright, like moths drawn to a candle flame. I forced them away. I could not let myself linger on Auri, not if I meant to keep the despair at bay.

And so I kept walking. Each step on the uneven dirt road felt like a small rebellion against common sense and better footwear. My boots were borrowed, and they made sure I never forgot it, gnawing at my heels like an insult that clung fast. If my feet bled, at least they had the decency to match the rest of me.

That’s when I saw them. Figures on the horizon, gray shapes surfacing against the dark. My first thought was a trick of the lantern, its erratic light twisting shadows into men. My second thought was more immediate, more solid. I was in danger. But before I could step away, one of them called out.

“Still warm,” It was Wil’s voice, sharp and cutting as his silhouette came into focus. “Better fix that.”

The fist came quick and crooked, a punch full of fury that smashed into my jaw before I could breathe his name. My vision cracked wide as the taste of plum and nutmeg burst bright and bitter in my mouth. For a moment, I swayed, swamped by dizziness, my limbs flailing like a sapling bent too far in the wind.

Anger surged through me, hot and sharp as Wil’s knuckles. My fists clenched on their own, and I took a step forward. Before I could move any farther, Simmon slipped in between us. He caught Wil’s wrist in one hand, holding it tightly enough to restrain, but loose enough that he could let go if needed.

“Damn the both of you,” Sim said, his voice strained not by volume but by weight. His body was trembling, whether from anger or the cold I couldn’t tell.

Wil looked away, breathing hard, though the fire hadn’t completely left him. When Sim was certain we wouldn’t lunge at one another again, he stepped back and turned to face us both.

“You are right to be angry,” Sim told Wil. “I don’t condone what he’s done either. But black hands, Wil. I saw the look on your face when I told you he was safe. You were relieved. Don’t act like you don’t care.”

Wil met his glance but said nothing, his jaw clenched hard enough to snap bone. When it was clear Sim would neither budge nor bark, Wil pulled back, but the anger in his eyes smoldered still, banked but not extinguished.

Sim watched him retreat, then turned to me, his face caught halfway between worry and disappointment. “Kvothe,” he started. My name fell soft, like a pebble into water, rippling outward.  

I raised a hand to stop him. My voice pushed up my throat and broke into the suffocating silence. “If I could have saved Lorren, I would have.” The words broke apart in the cold air. Shame wrapped itself around my chest and tangled on my tongue as I tried to speak. I opened my mouth to say something more, but the rest would not come.

Wil’s expression barely shifted. His anger carved lines across his face, but his tone grew colder when he finally spoke. “It’s not just Lorren, Kvothe. It’s the Archives. You put generations of reputation at risk of being tainted, and for what? Your curiosity?” He spat the word like it burned to even hold it in his mouth.

“It wasn’t just that,” I said, defensive without meaning to be. But how could I explain the weight of what I’d found, the truths I had only begun to uncover? They wouldn’t believe me. Tehlu help me, even if I told them they wouldn’t believe.

“Then explain it,” Wilem said, his voice brittle and low. “You can’t keep everything buried. Not this. Not anymore.”

“You owe us the truth,” Sim added gently, though his gaze was firm. “After everything, tell us.”

I breathed out, heavy and slow, as if exhaling might purge the shame lodged in my ribs. I opened my mouth to argue, to deflect, but stopped. They were right. More than that, they deserved it. So I let the fight drain out of me, shoulders slumped under the weight of my words.

“You’d better get comfortable,” I muttered darkly, the words trying and failing to carry humor.

Sim gestured down the road. “Tell us on the way.”

I blinked. “You’re coming with me?”

“Of course we are,” Sim said, incredulous. “Do you think we’d let you do this alone?”

Wilem nodded, his hand darting out to pull me upright with a strength that was startling. “You’re an idiot, but you’re our idiot.”  

Something warm and messy knotted itself in my chest. I turned away quickly, shielding my expression from their eyes. “You know I'm going to Renere, right?”

Wil smiled faintly. “And chasing after Ambrose,” he said. “I figured that much out.”

“Then you know this ends poorly,” I managed, biting back a choke of laughter that bordered on tears.

“We’ve stuck beside you through worse,” Sim said, patting me on the shoulder. “We’re your friends, Kvothe. Stop being so surprised by it.”

With that, the road ahead suddenly felt lighter. It was not any shorter, but it was lighter all the same.

### * * *

A few hours later, we caught a ride on a passing fetter cart. We clambered into the back and let the farmer flick the reins. The road was rough. The cart rocked beneath us, wood groaning, axles crying, dust curling up behind in lazy snakes. Silence grew thick around us. Only the slow creak of wheels, the tired grunt of an old man, the hush of afternoon light.

It was there, jostled along by road and memory, that I let the words tumble out. The road. The Edema Ruh. The laughter of my parents in firelight. Their murder. The shadow under the stars. The secret name of the Chandrian. I spoke on. I didn’t stop. Wilem was still and silent, eyes fixed on the horizon. Sim leaned forward, broad shoulders hunched, gaze lost among the battered boards of the cart.

And when my story ended, it was as if I had pulled a thorn from my own heart. It hurt. It helped. Teccam wrote that confession draws the poison out, makes the wound clean. Perhaps he was right. Some of the poison bled away.

Not all. Doubt still lingered, faint and flickering between us like a shadow in the dust. Wilem hid it well, but I saw the glance he shared with Sim. Neither spoke, neither needed to. I said nothing. What more could I say?

I shifted focus instead, drawing on my growing skill with Naming. They watched in quiet fascination as I called a ring of stone into being. I slipped into onto my finger beside and the simple amber one Auri had given me.

“Rings like these,” I murmured, flexing my fingers, “are meant to give my enemies pause.”

“Or make them laugh,” Sim quipped with his customary optimism.

Wilem just shook his head. “You’ll draw attention, good or bad. That armor cuts both ways.”

We all knew he was right.

### * * *

It was Wil who saw them, his sharp eyes catching the circle of greystones on a bluff ahead. He gestured, drawing our attention to the ancient monoliths. We bid goodbye to the farmer and made our way toward them.

Standing beneath the stones, I couldn’t help but feel their quiet power. They stood like giants too tired to move, their surfaces worn smooth by the slow fingers of time. I was reminded of a passage I’d read in “En Temerant Voistra”, whispering about their use as gates to the Fae. That memory had barely surfaced before I rushed to retrieve the book from my travel sack. Wil, Sim, and I pawed through it under the afternoon light.

As the hours slipped into night, we began to make real progress. Among us, Wilem was undoubtedly the better scholar. His patience and skill in Temic put my hurried translations to shame. Yet even he faltered when confronted with a single word, stopping to ponder its meaning.

He murmured, "Dance?" disbelief coloring his voice as he scratched his head.

Sim let out a short scoff. "That can't be right. Are you sure about that one?"

But I said nothing. In the quiet of my mind, Denna's voice returned to me, her question rising gentle as warmth. “Do you know the secrets of stones?” I placed my hands on the nearest surface and leaned into the hum.

The Name didn’t come as a sound but a shape. Soft at first, round at the edges. Then sharp. The weight of it spread out, vast yet contained, pressing back against me like the tide. When it came whole, it left my lips before I could stop myself. “Cyaerbasalien.”

The stones shifted beneath my hand as the Name took root, a low tremor rippling through the circle. The world paused for a breath, then stilled.

“It didn’t work,” I began, frustration already bleeding into my voice.

But then Sim’s hand settled gently on my shoulder and stopped me. “Kvothe, look,” he whispered, lifting his finger to the sky.

I followed his gaze. The stars above were wrong. They drifted in unfamiliar patterns, trembling faintly, as if unsure whether they belonged. The air clung thick and sweet around us, like the memory of distant music.

We had crossed into the Fae.
