# CHAPTER 45.

## ONCE KING, ALWAYS KING.


THE COLD BIT deep enough to find bone.  

“Reshi,” Bast muttered through chattering teeth, “next time we stake out a rooftop, I’m bringing a brazier.”  

I pressed a finger to my lips but kept my eyes on the streets below. Torches wound through Renere’s alleys in scattered processions, some carried by late-night revelers, others by the watch, all twisting and doubling back through the maze of streets. The flames flickered in the wind, and I tracked each one, searching for patterns, for purpose, for anything that might lead us to her. The Counting House roof was no comfortable perch. Loose tiles scraped and shifted beneath our feet, each movement louder than I liked. The wind cut sharp through every gap in our clothing, but I would have endured worse than cold and crumbling tiles. Auri was out there somewhere, held by men who saw her as a symbol rather than a person. And symbols, I knew, were only useful as long as they served their purpose.  

“She deserves better than this,” I said, the words barely louder than breath.  

Bast didn’t argue. He knew better than to waste words on what we both understood. Two nights she’d been gone. Two nights since the cultists had stolen her from the White Citadel, quick and quiet as thieves stealing silver in the dark. We’d spent most of today tracking rumors through the city’s gutters and getting nowhere. Now we waited in the cold, hoping the night would offer what the day had hidden.  

Bast shifted beside me, and I caught the tension in his shoulders that meant he’d noticed something. His eyes narrowed with that particular sharpness that meant he was seeing with more than mortal sight.  

“There,” he murmured, gesturing with his chin toward the masked figures below. “They’re moving with purpose tonight. Not just painting walls.”  

I studied them more carefully. He was right. These weren’t random vandals. They moved with the certainty of those who had somewhere specific to be.  

“Following them might lead us to her,” I said.  

“Or to whoever’s leading them.” Bast’s voice took on the careful tone of someone who’d been mulling too long on a thought. “Reshi, I’ve been thinking about what we learned today. Three different people had three different silences when I asked for their leader’s name. You’d expect them to lie, to hide it from us, but this was different. It was as if they didn’t know what they were trying to remember.” He scraped his tongue against his teeth and frowned. “It’s the same forgetting we saw with Prince Trenati. The same holes where memory should live.”  

He leaned forward, his green eyes catching the moonlight, turning them gold. “I think he’s their leader, Reshi. I think Trenati has her.”  

“That would make sense,” I said slowly, pieces clicking together in my mind. “The Feyda cultists need royal blood to legitimize their cause.”  

“Yes, and they’ve made her their banner, their proof that dead kings could still hold court. But whoever leads them,” Bast’s mouth twisted with the bitter taste of recognition, “Trenati or otherwise, the Quarter has them now. Has been feeding on the whole lot of them for some time, judging by how much has already been eaten away.” He paused, tilting his head as if listening to something only he could hear. “I can smell it on the wind, Reshi. That particular absence where something should be. Like a hole in the world shaped like a person.”  

“What do you mean?” I asked, though something cold was already settling in my stomach.  

“Remember what I told you about the Whispering Quarter?” Bast’s voice carried that teaching tone he rarely used. “How places can be taught to forget? It’s not just places. When someone stays too long, when they root themselves too deep in that forgetting, even if it’s against their will, something terrible happens.” He shrugged, but the gesture carried weight, like a man adjusting a burden on his shoulders. “The Quarter starts unwriting them from the world. First their deeds, then their face, then their name. Until even they forget who they were. It doesn’t care if you’re a prince or a princess. It doesn’t care if you’re there by choice.”  

“I won’t let the Quarter have her,” I said, and the words came out soft as snow falling. “Wil and Sim are already gone. Because of me. Because I brought them here.” My voice caught on their names, two syllables that held entire worlds. “I won’t let their deaths mean nothing. I won’t let her fade into forgetting.”  

Bast shivered, though I knew it wasn’t from the cold. “You don’t have to carry this alone, Reshi.”  

A sound of metal scraping against metal caught my ear, and my eyes traced it to three shapes moving near the bakery at Teccam Square. They wore masks and moved with the hubris of knowing that darkness made them invisible. In their hands, brushes dripped red as fresh wounds. Another name for the walls. Another cry for a dead king who couldn’t hear them.  

“Time to find what we’re looking for,” I said, already moving toward the roof’s edge.  

“Finally,” Bast breathed, and followed me down from the cold.  

### * * *  

The painters hadn’t traveled far. They stood at the bakery still, the tall one holding a bucket while another drew letters across the window glass. Feyda. The name spread across the city like blood through water, marking every surface that would hold paint.  

The one with the bucket noticed me first. He nudged his companion, who turned with laughter still dying on his lips. They looked at me the way you might look at a ghost that had forgotten it was dead. Barefoot, hollow-eyed, clothed in rags that had once been something better. I must have seemed more apparition than threat.  

“Where is Princess Ariel?” My voice came sharp and sudden as winter wind.  

“Who?” The tall one asked, tilting his head as if considering a strange sound.  

“The girl you stole two nights past. The one you’ve wrapped in your dead king’s name like a shroud.”  

His mouth opened, then closed. The paint on the glass behind him dripped like tears. Red tears for a red name.  

The youngest of them, barely more than a boy beneath the soot and fear, stammered out broken words. “She was taken to the stone place. North of the Citadel. The old gate, the black one. Calanthis crypt.”  

“Who gave the order?” I stepped closer, and my shadow fell across them like a promise. “Who commands you?”  

The boy’s face twisted into something painful. “He did?” The words stumbled and fell. “I can’t hold his name. It just slips away.”  

His hands trembled as he tried to shape meaning from nothing.  

“Was it Prince Trenati?” I asked, watching his face carefully.  

“Who?” The confusion in his eyes was genuine, terrible in its completeness. “There’s someone. I know there’s someone.” He pressed his palms against his temples, desperate. “Why can’t I see his face? He was there this morning. He spoke to us. But now it just hurts to think.”  

“The Calanthis heir,” I tried again. “Roderick’s youngest son.”  

The boy blinked slowly, painfully. “Roderick had sons?” The question came out broken. “I thought there was just the daughter. The princess we found.”  

The boy’s eyes cleared suddenly, focusing on me with terrible clarity. “But you,” he whispered, the words barely finding shape. “You’re real. You’re the one they blame for everything.”  

I met his gaze and held it steady. “Say my name.”  

“Kvothe Kingkiller.” The words came out thin as thread, but they came out whole.  

“Good.” I leaned closer, close enough that he could see the truth written in the hollow of my eyes. “The stone place. The Calanthis crypt. Tell me exactly how to find it.”  

### * * *  

The graveyard sprawled north of the Citadel like a stone garden where nothing grew but memory. But even memory grew strange here. Some headstones stood clear and proud, their names carved deep and certain. Others bore inscriptions that looked eaten away, not by weather or time, but by something more deliberate. Names half-carved, half-forgotten, as if the stone itself had begun to doubt what it was meant to remember.  

Bast stopped suddenly, his hand hovering over a marker where a name should have been. “Reshi,” he said, his voice carrying that particular tone of Fae certainty. “These weren’t worn down by time.” His fingers traced the air above the stone, careful not to touch. “The Quarter’s fingers have been here. These names are being eaten.”  

We picked our way through the paths, following the boy’s directions past monuments to the forgotten and markers for the half-remembered. The silence here was different from other silences. Thicker. Older. The kind that had been growing for generations and had recently learned to feed on itself.  

Bast found the gate first. Black iron standing half-open like a mouth paused mid-word. The name Calanthis wound through the metalwork in delicate lettering, though even these seemed to shimmer at the edges, as if they too might fade given time. We passed through, our footsteps crunching on the gravel. Ahead, voices murmured low and reverent, the sound of prayer or madness or both braided together.  

“This place is being consumed,” Bast whispered, his voice carrying the kind of caution I rarely heard from him. “Like walking into someone else’s dream while they’re forgetting it.”  

On another night, wisdom might have made me pause. But wisdom and I had parted ways when they took her. “Stay if you want,” I said, my voice hard as the stones around us. “I’m going.”  

Around the final bend, the crypt entrance revealed itself. A massive stone slab sealed the tomb, and before it knelt five figures in robes that had forgotten their proper color. They swayed slightly, like wheat in wind that wasn’t there, mumbling words that might have been prayer if the words had remembered their proper order.  

Something cold and certain settled in my chest. “Where is she?”  

One figure rose with movements that seemed to argue with themselves about which direction was up. His mask dangled from fingers that had forgotten they were holding it. When he turned toward me, I saw what had become of Prince Trenati.  

“Blood and ash,” Bast breathed. His hand found my arm, gripping tight. “Reshi, look at his eyes.”  

The thing that had been Prince Trenati stood there, but standing was all he managed. His eyes were wrong, worse than wrong. Where iris and pupil should have been, there was only pale white marble, like windows that had been painted over from the inside. He looked through me or past me or into me, but never quite at me. His mouth hung slightly open, and he hummed tunelessly to himself, a song that had lost its words and most of its notes.  

“The Quarter has him,” Bast said, his voice barely above a whisper. “It’s eaten through to his Name, Reshi. He’s becoming one of the forgotten things.”  

The other cultists didn’t defer to him. They didn’t even seem to notice him particularly, as if he were just another shadow among shadows. They followed the memory of following someone, but the someone had been eaten away, leaving only the hollow ritual behind.  

“Too late,” Trenati mumbled, and the words fell from his mouth like stones down a well. There was no rhythm to his voice anymore. Elodin had taught me once that speaking requires knowing your own name well enough to push it through your throat. Trenati’s words came out shapeless, nameless. “The river’s run dry. The name’s all empty now.”  

“Trenati.” I spoke his name clear and sharp, trying to cut through whatever fog had claimed him.  

He tilted his head at the sound, a puppet whose strings had gotten tangled. His blind white eyes rolled in their sockets, seeking something they would never find. “I had a name,” he said, wonder creeping into his voice like a child discovering snow. “Didn’t I? They sang it once. In halls of white. When summer still remembered my face.”  

The other cultists stirred uneasily. One turned to look at him, confusion blooming across her face. She looked at him the way you look at a stranger wearing familiar clothes, someone you’re certain you should know but can’t place. They followed habit now, not the man. The idea of authority. The ghost of what leadership might have been.  

“Where is Ariel?” I asked again, gentling my voice the way you might gentle a frightened animal.  

“Ariel.” He tasted the word, rolling it on his tongue like something foreign and familiar at once. “She was for the stone. To make things right. To remind them. To remind us?” His face crumpled into confusion, the expression of a man trying to hold water in his hands. “It’s all full of holes inside. Can you feel them?”  

I stepped forward, and the cultists reached for their weapons, more from instinct than purpose. They didn’t know why they should stop me. They only knew that stopping people was what guards did.  

I spoke the Name of stone.  

Not gently. Not kindly. Eight headstones around us shattered at once, exploding into dust and memory. The sound was like music made of breaking, a symphony of endings. The cultists scattered, fled, their purpose forgotten in the face of something they could still understand. Fear, at least, needed no name to be real.  

Only Trenati remained, swaying slightly on his feet, still humming that tuneless song.  

“Is she alive?” I demanded. “Nod if she lives.”  

He nodded, the gesture seeming to surprise him, as if his body had remembered something his mind had forgotten.  

“Good.” I leaned close enough to smell the forgetting on him, thick as smoke. It clung to him like grave dirt, like the absence of everything that had ever mattered. “For her sake, you keep breathing. Now go. Run. If I see you again, I won’t be so kind.”  

But he didn’t run. He couldn’t. Running requires knowing where you’re going, or at least where you’ve been.  

Trenati’s mouth moved, shaping words that had no sound behind them. Then he found his voice one last time.  

“You can’t open it,” he said, gesturing weakly at the stone with fingers that had forgotten their own shape. “The door knows me. But I’m not me anymore.”  

I turned to face the crypt’s entrance. The stone slab stood patient and ancient, a door that opened only for those the world still remembered. For those who hadn’t been eaten hollow by forgetting.  

“Then it’s fortunate I still know my name,” I said.  

I closed my eyes and listened for stone’s true voice. Every stone has one, deep and slow and older than words. I knew stone the way I knew silence, the way I knew my own heartbeat. I didn’t break the door. Breaking would have been crude, obvious, the kind of solution that comes from not truly understanding. Instead, I asked it to forget who it was keeping out and to lie down this burden of guarding a grave. I suggested that, perhaps, it might want to fulfil its dream of being a breakfeast table instead.  

The stone shuddered once, a sound like the earth taking a breath. Then it fell away, crashing to the side and then rolling away down the gravel path.  

Behind me, Trenati collapsed to his knees, his hands rising to touch his own face as if checking whether it was still there. His fingers found his empty eyes, and a sound escaped him that might have been a sob or might have been laughter. It was hard to tell when a voice had forgotten how to shape either one.  

Bast touched my shoulder gently. “We need to go, Reshi,” he said, and there was something in his voice I rarely heard. Fear. Not of Trenati, but of what had happened to him. “The Quarter’s hunger grows when it feeds. We’ve lingered too long already.”  

I looked at Trenati one last time. This hollow thing that had once been a prince, had once been someone’s son, had once had a name that mattered. Bast was right. The Whispering Quarter had done worse than kill him. It had made him into nothing while letting him watch it happen.  

I felt no satisfaction leaving him behind. Only a cold kind of pity, the sort you feel for broken things that can never be mended.  

### * * *  

I expected chains. Perhaps some cruel ritual circle drawn in salt or blood. Maybe the remnants of whatever madness they’d thought would restore their dead king’s name.  

Instead, I found stillness.  

Auri sat in the chamber’s heart, moonlight painting her silver and shadow in equal measure. But she wasn’t bound. She wasn’t imprisoned. She simply sat, as if she’d been waiting there since before the stones were set, as if this moment had always been approaching, inevitable as sunrise.  

On the far wall, someone had carved words into the stone. A prophecy, perhaps, or a promise. But even these had been partially rubbed away, eaten by the same forgetting that had claimed Trenati. Only fragments remained.  

> “...and the king who was never born will be remembered by none.”  
> “...and so he fades, barefoot into nothing.”  

The words seemed to pulse with their own absence, the missing parts somehow louder than what remained.  

“Auri.”  

Her head snapped up at my voice. And just like that, the spell broke. She ran, her feet skipping almost soundlessly over ancient stone, and crashed into my chest with the weight of rain finally finding earth.  

“Kvothe,” she said, breathing my name against my chest like it was the only word that mattered. Like it was the only word that could still matter. “My Ciridae. You came for me.”  

I held her close, felt the bird-bone delicacy of her, the way she seemed made more of light than substance.  

“I thought I’d forgotten your face,” she said, pulling back just enough to look at me. Her eyes were wide and wild and wonderfully Auri. “Everything else was coming undone like a sweater with a pulled thread. The walls kept trying to tell me I was someone else. That I had always been someone else. But I kept your name. I said it over and over like a song I was afraid I’d forget. I knew if I had that, if I could remember your name, then I was still real.”  

Her hands found mine, and I felt her fingers trace the gaps where my own fingers should have been. She didn’t flinch. She simply held what was left, as if the missing parts were just another kind of presence.  

I swallowed hard. “You are real.”  

Auri smiled, faint and glowing.  

“Good,” she said still holding my hands. Her face gleamed in the moonlight, a mixture of relief and exhaustion.  

“Take me home, Kvothe. Back to the Underthing, where everything is proper and safe and true.”
