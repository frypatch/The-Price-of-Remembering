# CHAPTER 45

## ONCE KING, ALWAYS KING  

“RESHI, IS THIS really necessary? It’s colder than the Fae Queen’s heart up here,” Bast groused, hugging his arms tight against himself.  

"Shhh," I hissed, motioning for silence. My eyes stayed fixed on the streets below, scanning the trails of torchlight that wound through Renere’s dark alleys.  

The rooftop of the Counting House wasn’t a comfortable perch. Loose tiles shifted underfoot, and the air was sharp with the bite of winter. But none of that mattered. Auri was out there somewhere.  

“She deserves better than this, Bast,” I murmured.  

He didn’t argue. Instead, he filled me in with what little information he’d gathered. Auri had been taken from the White Citadel two nights ago, stolen by a group of Feyda cultists. The why of it didn’t matter to me nearly as much as the fact that no one had stopped them. Prince Trenati and his followers were using her to prop up their delusions: pawns and sacrifices in their fractured game of thrones.  

“I’ll burn this city to the ground before I let them harm her,” I said softly.  

Bast shivered, though it had nothing to do with the cold. “Reshi, you don’t have to handle this alone.”  

As he spoke, I caught it. The faint sound of jangling metal carried on the wind. My gaze traced the noise to three figures moving by torchlight near a bakery on the corner of Teccam Square. They were masked, their movements sure. Painters of revolt, vandals of the night.  

“Time for answers,” I said, already moving toward the awning we’d climbed earlier.  

“Finally,” Bast muttered as he dropped down after me, his usual humor laced with anticipation.  

### * * *  

The painters hadn’t gone far. They were still at the bakery, the tall one holding a bucket while another painted bold red letters across the glass. *Feyda.* The dead king’s name, slashed onto the storefront like a bloody epitaph.  

The man with the bucket saw me first. He nudged the tall one, who paused mid-laugh and turned. None of them looked particularly threatened by my sudden arrival. I couldn’t blame them. I was barefoot, half-starved, and unarmed. Not a threat, just a walking specter.  

“Where is Princess Ariel?” I asked, my voice sharp as flint.

The tall one tilted his head, staring at me like a puzzle carved half-wrong. “The who?”

“Ariel. The girl you took two nights ago. The one who doesn’t belong to your broken gods.”

He opened his mouth as if to respond, then closed it again. He looked, briefly, at the spray of paint dripping across the bakery glass: Feyda scrawled like blood.

Beside him, Clyde—young, soot-streaked, more boy than man—stammered uncertainly. “She… she was taken somewhere. The, uh...” He frowned, eyes flicking left and right like chased birds. “To the… stone place. North of the Citadel. There’s a gate. Old and black.”

“Who ordered it?” I stepped closer, voice low. “Who gave the command?”

Clyde blinked. “He did. He—” He stopped. “I—” His hands trembled. “I don't remember his name.”

His brow furrowed. His lips moved without sound—trying to press meaning into shape.

“Tall man?” I supplied. “Dark-haired. Wears a ring you can’t quite look at.”

Clyde’s face twisted, as if remembering something painful. “Yes. Yes, that’s him… He had a title, once, I think.” He shivered. “But it feels like I dreamed it. He wasn’t… he wasn’t anyone. Not really.”

“He was a prince,” I said.

Clyde blinked. “Was he?”

He looked at me, confused and afraid. Then his eyes widened in sudden clarity.

“You’re… him,” he whispered.

I met his gaze. “Say it out loud.”  

“Kvothe Kingkiller,” Clyde repeated, his voice barely audible.  

“Good.” I leaned in closer. “Now, Clyde, tell me where they’ve taken her.”  

### * * *  

The boy’s information led us to the graveyard on the outskirts of the Citadel. Neither Bast nor I had any idea where the crypt might be, so we searched in silence, following paths that twisted among weathered stones and frostbitten elms.  

It was Bast who found it first—a gate of black iron left half-open, the name *Calanthis* wrought delicately in the bars. We stepped inside, moving carefully along the gravel path lined with gnarled trees. Ahead, faint voices reached us, their cadence low and unhurried.  

“Reshi,” Bast whispered, his tone cautious. “This doesn’t feel right. Maybe we should wait—see how many we’re up against.”  

On another night, I might have agreed. But not then. Not with her so close. “Wait here if you want,” I said, my voice hard. “I’m going.”  

Rounding the final bend, we came into view of the crypt’s entrance. A large stone slab sealed the tomb, and five figures knelt before it.  

Something cold settled inside me. “Where is she?” I demanded.

One of the figures straightened. His robes sagged wrong on his frame, as though he'd forgotten how shoulders worked. His mask dangled from one hand, thin fingers twitching. He turned toward me.

No sneer. No defiance. Just a kind of distant awareness, like the light behind his eyes flickered from some other room.

“Too late…” he mumbled. “The river’s run. The name’s gone dry...”

“Trenati.” I said his name aloud—cutting through the dark like a thrown blade.

He looked up at me with wide, washed-out eyes. His irises were gone—only misted marble where color should be. It made it hard to tell whether he looked through me or past me.

“I had a name,” he whispered, as though I’d mentioned it first. “Didn’t I? They… they sang it once. In white halls. In summer light.”

“Where is Ariel?” I repeated, more gently. A priest in the ruins of something he didn't understand.

“Ariel…” The syllables lingered on his lips like dust. “Yes, she was meant for the stone. Meant to make things right. To remind them. But I... I forget what she was meant to remind.” He smiled. “It's all full of holes inside. Can you feel them?”

One of his followers turned toward him at that—confused by the lack of leadership. Their gaze held no reverence. Just mistrust. They didn’t know him—not really. They obeyed the habit, not the man.

“She’s still alive?”

He drew in a rickety breath, then offered the only true gesture left to him: a nod. 

“Good.” I leaned in closer, my voice dropping to a whisper. “For her sake, you’ll live.” I pulled my hand away. “Now go. Run. Don’t let me see your face again.”  

Trenati spoke one last time—his voice like leaves blowing through bone.

“You can’t open it. It knows me. And I’m… not me anymore.”

I turned toward the slab of stone. Great and grave and ancient. A gate unsealed only by those the world still remembers.

“Then it’s lucky I’ve kept my Name,” I whispered.

Closing my eyes, I listened for it—the quiet thrum that threads through stone, the weight of it beneath names and nations. I knew stone. Knew its silence. Knew how to ask gently.

I didn’t break the door. I asked it to forget who it had been locked for. And to open for me instead.

The slab shuddered, trembled once like a sleeper woken out of true, and fell crashing to the side.

Behind me, Trenati slumped to his knees, hands rising to grasp his own face as if trying to remember how it once fit. “That should have been mine,” he whispered.

I left him behind. 

### * * *  

I wasn’t sure what I expected—chains, rituals, some cruel geometry drawn on the floor.

Instead, I found stillness.

Auri sat in the center of the chamber, moonlight painting her as though she'd been waiting there all along. Like she'd planted the moment weeks back, just so it could bloom now. Cradled in shadow, she looked so small—and so shockingly alive.

“Auri…”

Her head snapped upward. And just like that, the spell broke. She ran, her feet slipping almost soundlessly over ancient stone. She crashed into me like rain, not a weight, but a joy too old to remember.

“Kvothe,” she said, breathing the name against my chest like a psalm. “My Ciridae. You came.”

I held her fiercely, and felt the ache uncoil.

“I thought I’d forgotten your face,” she said, drawing back slightly, eyes wide and wild. “Everything was unraveling. But I remembered your name. Over and over. I knew if I had that, then I was still real.”

I swallowed hard. “You are real.”

Auri smiled, faint and glowing.

“Good,” she said still holding my hands. Her face gleamed in the moonlight, a mixture of relief and exhaustion.  

"Take me home, Kvothe. Back to the Underthing, where everything is proper and safe and true.”
