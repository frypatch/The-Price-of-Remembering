# CHAPTER 6.

## THE BREATH OF THE PEAKS.


THE HUM OF VOICES and the clinking of tankards seeped upward from the packed common room at Anker’s, muffled but steady, like the pulse of a living thing. It was a sound I should have been part of, thickening the air with chords from my lute, stoking laughter with stories. Instead, I sat on the edge of my narrow bed, staring at the pack I had thrown together in no more than ten minutes.  

The bag was too simple, perhaps, but it was the best of what little I owned. Inside, I had shoved a waterskin, a loaf of bread gone dry at the edges, and a tightly rolled blanket. My lute in its case, strapped to the side. Silent. Disapproving.  

I hesitated. It was reckless to leave, foolish even. But you have to understand, I had just watched a good man die with his work unfinished. I couldn’t help but wonder, what else remained undone?  

I’d seen it in others too. People who spent decades preparing for their dream, only to find when they finally reached for it that their hands had forgotten the shape. The trail they’d meant to walk no longer fit their stride. The story they’d meant to tell had become a stranger’s tale.  

The mountains were calling now. Wait a year, maybe two, and I’d still know I should answer. But I’d no longer know why it mattered.  

I shouldered my pack. Some stories demand to be lived before you outgrow them. Some songs need to be sung before gravel finds your voice.  

I could almost hear Anker’s voice, half-accusing, half-laughing, with a smile buried in the words. Leaving already? We’ve a full house tonight.  

But I didn’t answer the phantom question. Instead, I scrawled a hasty note and set it neatly on my bed.  

> “Anker,”  
> “A personal matter requires my attention.”  
> “I’ll return in a few days.”  
> “My thanks, as always.”  
> “Kvothe.”  

I knew the note would not satisfy him, but Anker was no fool. He would take his irritation and turn it to good use. There would be fuller mugs. There would be thicker slabs of bread. Customers would leave with heavy bellies and light purses, and his scowl would fade in the busy work of the day.  

But even so, when I turned to leave, something pressed at me harder than any pack. It was the ache of knowing that this was my home. These were my people. They would help me, as they always had, and they would understand. But my leaving would weigh on them. I would not be here to share the burden, and the work would be no lighter for my absence.  

I stepped out into the night, the cool air striking my face. The street was alive with students, their laughter spilling from doorways and corners as they stretched out these final days of unexpected freedom. I left Imre behind. The mountains wouldn’t wait.  

### * * *

The wind met me halfway to the Six Sisters, restless and sly. At first, it was gentle, threading playfully through my hair and snapping at the edges of my hood. But as the land began to slope upward beneath my boots, so did the wind’s mood change. It tugged harder, sharp and impatient, as if testing whether it could pull me back or push me onward.

By the second day, its playful nature had vanished entirely. The mountains rose jagged and solemn ahead, their rocky faces indifferent, their uppermost peaks capped faintly with snow that glinted in the weak light. I climbed carefully, moving with deliberate steps, each breath drawn thinner as though the air itself were shrinking. At times, the wind screamed between the crags, a wild and furious thing. There was no question about whose domain I had entered. Here, the wind was not just part of the weather. It was alive, a raw force that seemed to question my right to trespass. 

Each night on the mountainside, I found myself beneath a blanket of stars so wide it seemed as though the world might collapse under their weight. I huddled beneath my blanket, my body aching from hours of climbing, my thoughts circling themselves like a hungry hawk. The wind howled in the night, singing its secrets I was too deaf to hear. What did I think I would learn? Did the wind even have a secret, or had I left Imre chasing ghosts of my own imagining?

The ascent grew steeper with each passing day. By the third morning, I felt utterly alone. The trees had long fallen away, leaving only jagged stone and patches of black ice that glared up at me from the ground like unkind mirrors. I measured my breath in shallow bursts, each careful step anchoring me to the moment.

On that morning, when the wind was sharpest and the air cold enough to sting at my cracked lips, something happened.

I had stopped to rest on a rocky ledge, perched precariously far above the world I had risen from. The wind clawed at me with ferocity, battering my chest and legs, blinding me by whipping my hair into my eyes. And then, suddenly, it stopped.

The absence was so sharp it startled me, as if the world had exhaled once and held its breath in anticipation. My heart pounded in my chest. The wind didn’t vanish entirely. It wasn’t a retreat, but rather a pause that felt still and deliberate. Something brushed my cheek then, soft and faint, not forceful or cruel. Its touch wasn’t tender, but it wasn’t angry either. I could not name what it was, only that I felt something beneath it. There was a recognition, or at least the suggestion of one.

The thread hummed just out of reach. For the first time, I didn’t try to pull it closer. I simply listened.

When the wind shifted again, it almost felt like it lingered a moment longer before moving on.  

I descended the slopes with steps that were lighter, though no less cautious. I carried nothing with me but my breath, my lute, and the small, thrilling certainty that when I truly called, the wind would come.  

### * * *

When I returned to Imre, it was near twilight. The city lounged beneath a sky painted in soft pinks and grays, the evening air cool against my skin. My boots found their way through familiar streets until the rest of the world seemed to fade behind me.  

Auri’s rooftop was where it always was, quietly hidden, holding its breath just for me. When I climbed the last set of stones, I found her perched on the edge, her legs swinging over a gap as carelessly as a child dangling them in water. She turned at the sound of my boots, and her face broke into a wide smile, as though the sky itself had gifted her the sight of me.  

“Welcome home, Kvothe,” she said, prim and polished, as though I had kept her waiting for precisely this moment.  

I returned her smile, setting my pack down with a low thump. “You always know,” I said.  

“Of course I do,” she replied, tilting her head with a smug twist to her lips. “The wind told me. Did you catch it?”  

I laughed, shaking my head. “Catch it? That’s the wrong question altogether.”  

Auri raised a finger, as if to challenge me. “But did you ride it?”  

“No.” I sighed, dropping to sit beside her. The stone was cool beneath me, a quiet contrast to the warmth her presence brought. “But I got closer.”  

“That’s good enough,” she said lightly. “You’ll be Taborlin the Great before you know it.”  

Her eyes drifted to the bulging sack at my side, and she gasped. “Oh! What did you find this time?”  

“A few things,” I said, reaching into my pack. “And this.” I pulled free a bundle of rich blue fabric, folded neatly and tied with a thin strip of leather. “A gift for you.”  

Her hands flew to her cheeks in delight. “For me?” she asked, her voice hushed the way one speaks of something sacred.  

“You said you liked my cloak,” I said, unfolding the fabric. It caught the fading light, the color deepening to the shade of evening skies just before the stars wake. “And since you don’t like used things, I thought you deserved one of your own.”  

She let me swing the cloak around her thin shoulders. It settled softly, wrapping her like dusk falling at the close of day. Her small hands clasped the edge, brushing its folds with reverence.  

“What’s it made of?” she asked, her voice full of longing.  

“Goose feathers and whispers from summer clouds,” I said. My voice held all the seriousness the moment deserved.

She laughed, bright and light, a chime caught in the open air. “Goose feathers alone are cruel. How thoughtful, to soften them with the kindness of clouds.”

“And what did you bring me?” I asked, invoking our ritual.  

Auri’s sly grin returned. She reached into her pocket with great deliberation and pulled out a small, weathered book. It was plain but old, its edges browned and its cover faintly embossed with swirls, like frost curling over the surface of glass.  

“This,” she announced. “It’s made of shadows and murmurs from long ago.”  

I took it carefully, running my fingers along its textured surface. It felt strangely warm, as though it had absorbed sunlight no one else could see. “What’s inside?”  

“Secrets,” she said simply. Her tone was so casual, so matter-of-fact, that it made me pause.  

“Secrets it keeps?” I asked, curious.  

“Secrets it tells,” she said, the words spreading like ripples in a still pond.  

Before I could ask more, Auri sprang to her feet, the cloak swirling around her like a storm caught in a teacup. “Play for me!” she said, twirling once, her arms spread wide.  

I pulled my lute from my pack, the familiar weight rough in my hands. The first chord rose into the air, soft and buoyant, and she began to turn, her toes brushing the stone with practiced lightness.  

The notes carried us both. My fingers guided the melody, weaving it through the cool evening air. Auri spun and spun, her bare feet tracing patterns on the rooftop as though they were writing something too beautiful for words. The stars above blurred with her motion, their light winding together with the sound of my music.  

Her laughter echoed briefly before fading into the stillness. When at last her movements slowed and my music trailed off, she collapsed into a heap of soft blue cloak and tangled golden hair, grinning up at me as though she’d captured the sky itself.
