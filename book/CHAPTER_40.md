# CHAPTER 40.

## CINDER.


“WE’RE FREE,” CINDER said, his voice spilling over with a relief so vast it bordered on reverence. He turned to the other Chandrian, the remnants of shadow still licking at their forms as they came together, each embracing the others with something raw, desperate, and uncomfortably human.  

The sight turned my stomach. They didn’t deserve this joy. My parents lay beneath the earth, their songs silenced. My troupe had burned to nothing while these monsters danced in the ashes. Cities had crumbled at their touch, and now they stood here celebrating as if pain could be washed clean by time.

My hands made themselves into fists without my permission. But what was I against the weight of their years? One man with broken fingers and a heart full of righteous fury. One man was nothing.

Then memory stirred, faint but clear. Marten's voice drifted back to me from the depths of the Eld, dry and knowing. "Call me the proper way, and I will come." He had shown me more than I had understood at the time, but I understood now.

I stepped forward, feeling the air in my lungs burn as I drew it deeper. Then, I spoke.  

“Great Tehlu, wrap me in your wings. Protect me from demons and creatures that walk in the night.”  

The Chandrian continued their reunion, oblivious.

My voice grew stronger, climbing like flame up dry wood. "Tehlu, in your name, watch over me."

A tremor rippled through them, subtle as wind through wheat. Still, there was no immediate reaction.

The words tore from my throat, each one sharper than the last. "Tehlu, shelter me from iron and anger. Tehlu, who the fire could not kill, watch over me in fire."

Cinder's head turned slightly, his face narrowing with curiosity as he sought my voice.

"Tehlu, who held Encanis to the wheel, watch over me in darkness." The prayer had become a battle cry, each word a stone thrown at heaven. "Tehlu, whose eyes are true, watch over me. TEHLU, SON OF YOURSELF, IN YOUR NAME, WATCH OVER ME."

"Kill him," Cinder commanded, his voice cutting cutting through the stunned silence.

Stercus surged toward me first, his massive form barreling through the night. But the wind knew my name better than I knew it myself. I called, and it answered. The gust that came was not gentle. It lifted him like a child's toy and flung him into the darkness.

Usnea came next, her silver blade singing its cold song. Again I called the wind, and again it obeyed. She tumbled across the stone, her mask catching moonlight as she rolled.

But there were seven of them. Seven against one. The math was simple and terrible.

Cinder hurled himself forward, the dull gray sword in his hand aimed for my heart.

Light split the world in half.

The first bolt fell between us like a judgment. It was bright. Bright as the birth of stars. Bright as the death of darkness. So bright that for one perfect moment Cinder became nothing more than a shadow painted against white fire. The air around us turned sharp and strange, filling with a distinct, sharp, and somewhat metallic smell.

He stumbled backward, his killing stroke forgotten, one arm raised against that terrible brightness as if he could ward it away with flesh and bone.

Another bolt carved the earth open, like the finger of God spilling fire where it touched. The air itself screamed, not with fear but with the simple physics of being torn apart and sewn back together in the span of a heartbeat.

Then they descended.

Eight figures wreathed in flame that was not flame but something holier and more terrible. Wings spread wide enough to shame the sky. Their swords burned with light that made looking painful and not looking impossible. Tehlu's angels had come wearing war like wedding clothes.

The battle that followed had no words. The Chandrian met them with fury born of centuries. The creatures from beyond the door fought with hunger that had festered in darkness since the world was young. But the angels moved through them like truth through lies, their blades leaving nothing but light in their wake.

I stood frozen, the sheer force of ancient power consuming everything around me. “Time to go,” Denna whispered, grabbing my wrist.

We ran. Behind us, angels screamed war songs that had no words, only fury. Behind us, creatures older than names howled their hunger at the stars. Behind us, stone melted and air burned and the mountain learned what it meant to weep. We ran toward the ridge with the singular focus of prey, toward anywhere that was not here.

"Where do you think you're going?"

The voice stopped us like a wall.

Cinder stood before us, having moved through space in ways that space should not allow. "You thought you could slip away?" He stalked forward, lips twitching into a feral grin and black eyes gleaming with cruel amusement. “Foolish children.”

I called the wind again, throwing everything I had into a screaming wall of air between us. Cinder simply planted his blade in the earth and leaned into it, unmoved and unmoving. His laugh was the sound of ice cracking under weight.

He moved again, that terrible speed, but this time his target was not me.

It was Denna.

"No!" The word tore from me as I threw myself forward, graceless and desperate. My body met his in a tangle of limbs and fury. We went down together, but Cinder spun away like lightning, and I saw the glint of his sword too late.

Pain shot through my left hand.

Then a deeper, quieter pain washed over me as three of my fingers fell to the ground.

I choked back a scream, staggering under the savage blow, but even as agony coursed through me, something in my chest burned brighter. Fury took root, and fury became strength. I crashed into him with everything I had left. My fist found his face once, twice, three times. I felt his nose break beneath my knuckles, heard the wet crack of cartilage giving way. My ruined hand found his silver hair and I drove his skull against the unforgiving earth.

Cinder roared, throwing me aside with inhuman strength. He pinned me, his fists falling like hammers. My face went slack from the impacts, blood filling my mouth as my vision blurred. 

He smiled then, the same smile he had worn the day he killed everything I loved.

My ruined hand reached to his face, smearing my blood across his eyes. For one precious moment, his vision was blinded. I tried to roll away, but his sword appeared in his hand as if it had always been there. He drove his boot into my chest, pinning me to the earth.

The blade rose high.

Then he froze.

Behind him stood Denna, breathing hard, her hand still wrapped around the handle of the knife she had driven into his neck.

"Pity," Cinder said, his voice conversational despite the steel in his spine. "You would have made a fine apprentice."

He turned with the blade still in his neck and drove his sword into her belly with the casual efficiency of a man closing a door.

“No!” I screamed, my voice breaking with raw anguish. A gale swelled beneath my fury, and the wind exploded outward, tearing Cinder from the ground and sending him spinning through the dark chaos.  

I was beside Denna in an instant.  

“Help me up,” she whispered, clutching the wound as her blood seeped between her fingers.  

I obeyed without thought, pulling her to her feet. We stumbled toward the ridge, her weight against me, my blood mixing with hers on the ancient stone. Behind us, the carnage dwindled into background noise. Survival became everything.

And yet, I turned. I don’t know why I turned, but I did, and I saw Cinder pull the knife from his neck with no more concern than a man removing a splinter. He tossed it aside and his eyes found mine. In that moment, I knew in my heart of hearts that he would never stop. That his act in this new lease on life would be to hunt us down.

But as I looked at him, something else happened. Like with Loeclos Box, the world peeled back his skin and showed me what lay beneath.

I saw Cinder as he truly was, down to the cold core of his being. I saw the young man he had been in Murellaa, who those closest had once considered virtuous. I saw how the malice that existed within him had taken hold. I saw how small betrayals layered blood upon his hands until he was forced to burn down his own people's silver tree. I saw how this first act had opened a door in him that could never quite close, and how the centunes of torment that followed had made him bitter, and cruel.

I lifted my ruined hand, blood spilling onto the ground, my voice filled with all the power that still stirred in me. “By my own blood, I bind you. By your own name, let you be accursed.” I roared a word, a chill wind tearing across the mountainside as I spoke the long name that lived at the heart of Cinder’s being. “This is my doom upon you. Your own name will turn against you. You and all who follow you will know no peace. This is my doom upon you!”

Cinder's face twisted from amusement to rage to something that might have been fear. He lunged toward us, only to be met by a burning sword as one of Tehlu’s angels descended upon him.

Denna tugged at my arm, her voice weak and pleading. “Let’s go.”

And so, we fled into the night.
