# CHAPTER 40.

## CINDER.


“WE’RE FREE,” CINDER said, his voice spilling over with a relief so vast it bordered on reverence. He turned to the other Chandrian, the remnants of shadow still licking at their forms as they came together, each embracing the others with something raw, desperate, and uncomfortably human.  

The sight turned my stomach. This wasn’t freedom—they didn’t deserve joy. My parents, my troupe, the cities they had reduced to ash—every atrocity they had so effortlessly wrought stacked like cords of firewood in my mind. They deserved punishment. Justice. Not this celebration. Yet as my hands curled into fists at my side, a bitter truth struck me: what could I, alone, truly do? Even with all my anger, all my fury, I was still only one man standing against centuries of slaughter.  

And then it happened. A thread of memory, faint but clear, drifted through the chaos. Marten’s words, dry with meaning. “Call me the proper way, and I will come.” The Eld had shown me more than I had understood at the time. Perhaps, even now, there was still a chance.  

I stepped forward, feeling the air in my lungs burn as I drew it deeper. Then, I spoke.  

“Great Tehlu, roll me in your wings. Protect me from demons and creatures that walk in the night.”  

No response. None of them so much as glanced my way.  

I raised my voice, louder and fiercer. “Tehlu, in his name, watch over me!”  

A tremor flickered through the group like a ripple in still water, but still, there was no immediate reaction. My voice grew sharper, rising like a blade from its scabbard. “Tehlu, shelter me from iron and anger!”  

Cinder's head turned slightly, his face narrowing with curiosity as he sought my voice.  

“Tehlu, who the fire could not kill, watch over me in fire!” I roared, the words pulling something vast and ancient out from deep within me. This time, more eyes followed: Tenet’s pale ones, Usnea’s frostbitten gaze, even Iax’s monstrous shape cocked its heavy head toward me.  

“Tehlu, who held Encanis to the wheel, watch over me in darkness! Tehlu, whose eyes are true, watch over me! TEHLU, SON OF YOURSELF, IN YOUR NAME, WATCH OVER ME!”  

“Kill him!” Cinder bellowed, his sharp tenor cutting through the stunned silence. He broke into a sprint, his blade like raw winter in his hand, gleaming and deadly.  

Stercus surged toward me first, his massive form barreling through the night. But the wind—the wind was mine. I shouted, and it answered. A tremendous gust lifted him clear off the ground, tossing him like a scrap of parchment battered by the storm.  

Another came for me, Usnea’s silver blade poised to strike. With another roar, I called the air, and the gale howled, sending her crashing shoulder first into the black arch. But there were too many, their numbers rising like the tide—unstoppable.  

Cinder hurled himself forward, the dull gray sword in his hand aimed for my heart.  

A crack of lightning split the sky, blinding white and sharp as shattered glass. The air itself shook, and the plateau was illuminated as though the noonday sun had broken through the gloom. Another bolt carved deep into the earth, spilling fire and stone into the air, scattering both Chandrian and nightmare beasts alike. The heavens screamed in defiance, and then I saw them.  

Eight figures descended, wreathed in divine flame. Wings burned bright against the carved night, their light cutting through the terrible shadow. Tehlu’s angels had come, their presence undeniable, their fury absolute.  

At the first touch of their burning swords, chaos erupted. They moved like fire itself, blinding and unrelenting. Chandrian and monstrosities fell equally beneath their blades, screams rising like bitter smoke.  

I stood frozen, the sheer force of ancient power consuming everything around me. “Time to go,” I whispered sharply to Denna, grabbing her wrist.  

We ran for the ridge as the battle roared behind us, the host's guttural wails carving through the night. My thoughts rallied around one clear purpose: escape. It wasn’t until the barbed sound of a voice pierced my ears that the terror set back in.  

“Where do you think you’re going?”  

Cinder materialized before us, his matte black eyes gleaming with cruel amusement. He stalked forward, lips twitching into a feral grin. “You thought you could slip away? Foolish children.”  

I called the wind, a wall of air screaming between us, but Cinder planted his blade in the soil and braced, his form unmoving. With a sharp laugh, he moved again, too fast, too precise. My panic surged as I realized his target wasn’t me—it was Denna.  

“No!” I threw myself forward, a collision of desperation and instinct driving me. My body sailed toward him, but Cinder’s deft grace betrayed my clumsy attack. He spun like lightning, and I saw the glint of his sword too late.  

Pain shot through my left hand.  

Then a deeper, quieter pain washed over me as three of my fingers fell to the ground.  

I choked back a scream, staggering under the savage blow, but even as agony coursed through me, something in my chest burned brighter. Fury took root. My mutilation wasn’t the end—it was a spark. Defiance surged, raw and terrible.  

With all my weight, I drove into him, tackling him to the ground. My fists slammed against his face, raw and breaking with each impact as his nose crumpled under the blows. I grabbed wildly, finding purchase in his silver hair, and smashed the back of his skull into the unforgiving earth.  

Cinder roared, throwing me aside with inhuman strength. He pinned me, bringing his fists down like stones. My face went slack from the impacts, blood filling my mouth as my vision blurred. He grinned, the same grin he wore the day he took everything from me.  

The rage returned.  

My ruined hand rose to his face, smearing my blood across his eyes. With his vision blinded, I scrambled, but his sword appeared in his hand as though summoned by his will. He drove his boot into my chest, pinning me to the earth, raising the blade high.  

Then he froze.  

Behind him, Denna stood, her breaths short and sharp, her hand clutching a small dagger buried in the back of his neck. For one moment, all her trembling fear vanished as she met his gaze.  

“Pity,” Cinder growled. “You would’ve made a fine apprentice.”  

He plunged his blade into her abdomen.  

“NO!” I screamed, my voice breaking with raw anguish. A gale swelled beneath my fury, and the wind exploded outward, tearing Cinder from the ground and sending him spinning through the dark chaos.  

I was beside Denna in an instant.  

“Help me up,” she whispered, clutching the wound as her blood seeped between her fingers.  

I obeyed, hauling her to her feet as we half-ran, half-stumbled toward the ridge. The carnage behind us dwindled into background noise. Survival became everything.  

But I turned. I don’t know why I turned, but I did, and I saw Cinder pull the shiv from his neck, tossing it aside. As he met my eye, I knew in my heart of hearts, he'd never stop now, that his first goal in this new lease on life would be to hunt us down. 

In that moment, staring back into his coal black eyes, I was suddenly perfectly awake, the world around me unveiled. I saw Cinder as he truly was, down to the root of his very being. 

His entire life became an open book to me. How his mistakes and regret had shaped him into the heartless creature he’d become. I saw then the young man within the walls of Murella, who those closest had once considered virtuous, but over the long centuries, the malice that existed within him had taken hold. I saw the blood upon his hands, how he had betrayed his people, and burnt down their sacred silver tree, how this act and the centunes of torment that followed had made him bitter, and cruel.

I lifted my ruined hand, blood spilling onto the ground, my voice filled with all the power that still stirred in me. “By my own blood, I bind you. By your own name, let you be accursed.” I roared a word, a chill wind tearing across the mountainside as I spoke the long name that lived at the heart of Cinder’s being. “This is my doom upon you! Your own name shall be turned against you! You, and all who follow you, will know no peace. This is my doom upon you!” 

At that moment, Cinder’s face twisted to fury. He lunged—only to be met by a burning sword as one of Tehlu’s angels descended upon him.  

Denna tugged at my arm, her voice weak and pleading. “Let’s go.”  

And so, we fled into the night.
