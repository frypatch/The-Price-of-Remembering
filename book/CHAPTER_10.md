# CHAPTER 10.

## A FOOLISH BARGIN.


I RETURNED TO Devi’s door with no excuse left to offer.  

Perhaps that was her plan. She scattered secrets like breadcrumbs, certain I would follow. Or perhaps I was simply too tired to care.  

When Devi opened the door, she barely glanced at me before stepping aside. The scent of cinnamon hung in the air. Devi’s scent, though I didn’t think of it that way at the time. “Kvothe,” she said, letting my name stretch off her tongue. “Back so soon? People will start to talk if you keep this up.”  

“Let them,” I said as I stepped inside. Devi moved back to her desk. The glint in her eye told me she’d already won.  

“And?” she asked, waving a hand. “Did you find what you were looking for?”  

“There’s more than you’re telling me,” I blurted. “You know more about what Lorren’s hiding, and you’ve been holding back.”  

Devi tilted her head, her smile cutting sharper. “Sweet Kvothe, that’s a bold accusation. And here I thought we were friends.”  

“Friends don’t play games like this.”  

“Oh, Kvothe, they absolutely do,” she said, leaning back against the edge of her desk. “But friendship doesn’t come cheap. You want to know what Lorren is keeping locked away? Get me into the Archives. Then we’ll talk.”  

“No,” I said. “Not a chance.”  

Devi arched a skeptical brow. “So sudden, so certain. Why not, darling boy? Surely there’s room enough for two clever, hungry minds in your hallowed stacks.”  

“There are places you don’t belong, Devi. Some doors wouldn’t close so cleanly after you passed through them.”  

Her expression didn’t falter, but her fingers drummed slowly against the edge of the desk. “I expected better of you, Kvothe. I really did. I thought you’d understand a simple bargain between civilized people.”  

“We’re not even having this conversation,” I snapped. I was pacing without realizing it. “I won’t risk it.”  

“You owe me,” she said quietly. “The reagents. You asked for my help. I gave it.”  

We argued. I don’t remember everything I said, but I remember the heat of it. I tried to use reason. Devi cut through it with precision. She was a professional. I was out of my depth.  

Looking back, I can see how neatly she’d backed me into this corner. But at the time, all I could see was the door I needed opened.  

“Fine,” I said. “But on my terms.”  

Her lips twitched into a smile. “How startlingly reasonable of you. And what, pray tell, are your terms?”  

“No action until we’ve settled on a solid plan. One we both agree on.”  

Devi inclined her head, her fingers resuming their rhythmic tap. “Fair enough,” she said. “Lucky for you, I’ve already given this some thought. We just need to borrow the keys.”  

She pulled a small vial from her pocket, no larger than her thumb. The liquid inside was deep red, catching the lamplight.  

“This,” she said, holding it aloft, “is a little marvel I’ve been tinkering with. Tasteless, odorless, and precise. A few drops in Lorren’s wine, and he’ll sleep deep and dreamless. More importantly, he’ll remember nothing when he wakes.”  

“Borrowing keys and drugging one of the Masters are two very different things.”  

Her smile had teeth in it. “You know, Lorren keeps the keys to the Four-Plate Door under his robe with little else. Curious place to tuck something so important, don’t you think?”  

“What are you saying?” I asked carefully, unable to tell if she was implying something darker or simply repeating a rumor.  

Her smile widened. “Nothing, darling. Just facts.”  

“I still don’t like this.”  

“I’d be worried if you did,” Devi said, setting the vial carefully on the corner of her desk. “But unless you’ve got a better plan?”  

I wanted to argue. Everything in me itched to push back. But I didn’t have another plan, and I was desperate enough to take the risk.  

“There’s one more condition. I insist on testing it first. On me.”  

Devi’s sharp laughter filled the room, fading almost as quickly as it began. When she saw my face, her amusement curdled. “You have my assurances. It works.”  

“That won’t do. If it doesn’t work exactly the way you promise, I need to know now.”  

She hesitated, her hand curling tight at her side. “Come back in three days,” she said, every word clipped. “I’ll have everything ready.”  

Neither of us moved. Then she dropped the vial into her pocket and sent me back out into the night.  

### * * *  

Three days felt like three years.  

The first day was unbearable. I kept hearing Vashet’s voice, sharp and demanding. “Which path lies closer to the Lethani? The one that endangers everyone? Or the one that preserves what you hold dear?”  

The second day, I joined Mola, Wil, and Sim for an afternoon game of Corners at Anker’s.  

On the first hand, Sim pushed his partner marker aside. “I’ll take it alone.” He took the first few tricks easily, but then hesitated. I saw the moment he realized his mistake before losing the rest to Wil.  

“Thought I knew where everything was,” Sim said sheepishly while gathering the cards.  

He spent the rest of the game trying more desperate measures to dig his way out of that hole.  

On the walk back, his words kept returning to me. But by the time I reached my room, I’d already pushed the thought away.  

By evening of the third day, I couldn’t ignore it anymore. Rather than return to my room, I found myself at the edge of the Underthing, not quite descending, not quite leaving. The air that rose from below was cool and familiar, carrying the peculiar mineral scent of deep stone and running water. I sat at the entrance for a long while, my lute across my lap, playing nothing in particular.  

Auri appeared from the shadows the way she always did, a sudden moon fae. She settled nearby without a word, hugging her knees to her chest. Her pale hair tumbled around her shoulders as she turned her face toward my music.  

The notes that came from my fingers were thin and uncertain. They stumbled and caught, holding none of the shape or easy certainty I found in better moments. Still, Auri listened. She always did.  

“You’re tangled,” she said as the last note faded into the still air. Her voice was soft but certain, as if she could see the snarl of my thoughts laid bare before her.  

I ran my fingers lightly over the strings, pretending to tune them. “Just restless.”  

Auri tilted her head, her pale hair catching the faintest glimmer of light from above. “No,” she said simply. “Not restless.”  

She didn’t press. That wasn’t her way. She simply stood, quick and quiet as a bird. For a moment she hesitated, balanced on the balls of her feet. Then she stepped away into the shadows, her movements soundless.  

I stayed where I was for a long time, staring at the entrance to the Underthing. Auri hadn’t ask questions, but just being near her reminded me how much she trusted me.  

I had to be better than this. For her, if nothing else.  

But that night, as I made my way back across the river toward Imre, I buried those doubts beneath the all-too-familiar tug of my own desires.  

### * * *  

Devi answered her door quickly, her sharp smile already in place. But she looked different than usual. Tired around the eyes, her hair slightly less composed. She’d been waiting, I realized.  

“Come inside,” she said.  

Her room had been rearranged. The usual clutter was pushed aside, leaving a clear space near the window. A narrow cot had been set up there, with a wool blanket folded at its foot. Beside it, a small table held a cup of water and a single red vial, smaller than the one she’d shown me before.  

“The measured dose,” she said, following my gaze. “Calculated for your weight, your constitution. I’ve accounted for everything.”  

“Everything?” I asked.  

Her jaw tightened slightly. “Everything I could account for. Alchemy isn’t arithmetic, Kvothe. There’s always a margin.”  

“How wide a margin?”  

“Narrow enough.” She picked up the vial, held it to the light. The liquid caught the glow and scattered it into a faint hue. “You’ll sleep. You’ll wake. You won’t remember the sleep itself. That’s the point. If it works on you, it will work on Lorren.”  

“And if it doesn’t work?”  

“Then we’ll know.” She pressed the vial into my hand. Her fingers were warm against mine, steadier than I expected. “Drink it. Lie down. I’ll be here when you wake.”  

I looked at the cot. The vial in my hand. Devi’s face, confident but not quite. I couldn’t believe I was doing this.  

I drank.  

The liquid was cool and sweet, with a metallic aftertaste. For a moment nothing happened. Then warmth spread from my stomach outward, like the first flush of good wine. My limbs grew heavy. The lamplight blurred golden at the edges.  

I made it to the cot before my legs stopped cooperating. The wool blanket was rough against my cheek. Devi’s face swam above me, blurred at the edges.  

“How long?” I managed.  

“A few hours,” she said, her voice coming from very far away. “Maybe less.” Her voice faded. “Just let it.”  

The world folded shut.  

### * * *  

My mind burned.  

That’s the only way I can describe it now, though at the time I had no words for what was happening. Thoughts raced through my head faster than I could grasp them, each one fragmenting into a dozen more before I could make sense of it. Memories flashed past. My parents’ fire burning blue, Cinder’s smile, Denna’s face in moonlight. Each one pulled a thread that unraveled into more memories, more connections, more thoughts spiraling away into darkness.  

I tried to slow down, to grab hold of something solid, but there was nothing to grip. Just endless churning momentum, my mind racing like a wheel spinning free of its axle.  

I reached for my Alar. The iron certainty I’d trained for years. It was there, but wrong. Slippery.  

Panic rose, but even the panic felt distant, another thought in the endless cascade.  

Time stretched and compressed. I lived years in moments, moments in years. And somewhere in that burning darkness, I became aware that something was wrong.  

Not wrong like a nightmare. Wrong like a cracked instrument. Still playing, but every note off.  

And then, finally, the darkness began to thin.  

### * * *  

I woke gasping.  

The light was wrong. Too bright, too sharp, slanting through Devi’s window at an angle that meant hours had passed. My body felt like it had been wrung out and hung to dry. My hands were trembling.  

Devi sat beside the cot, pale with deep shadows beneath her eyes. She’d been watching me, I realized. The whole time.  

“How long?” My voice came out cracked, barely recognizable.  

“Seven hours.” Her voice was flat, carefully controlled. “The formula predicted two, maybe three at most.”  

I tried to sit up. The room tilted dangerously, and I had to grip the edge of the cot to keep from falling. My thoughts felt wrong. Slow and slippery.  

“What happened?” I asked.  

“I was hoping you could tell me.” Devi leaned forward, her eyes searching my face.  

I tried to remember, but the details slid away like sand through my fingers. Fragments remained. The burning, the racing thoughts, the feeling of something cracked. But they wouldn’t cohere into anything I could describe.  

“It didn’t work,” I said finally.  

“It worked.” Devi’s jaw tightened. “You slept. You’re awake now.”  

“That’s not what I mean.” I held up my hand, watched it tremble. “Something’s wrong. I don’t feel right.” I searched for a better word but couldn’t find one.  

“You’re disoriented. That’s normal.”  

“No.” I tried a simple binding. A child’s exercise, linking my body heat to the warmth of the blanket. The connection formed, held for a moment, then slipped. Not broken. Just wrong.  

Devi saw my face change. “What is it?”  

“Nothing.” The lie came automatically. “Just disoriented, like you said.”  

She studied me for a long moment, and I could see her weighing whether to press. Finally she sat back, her expression unreadable.  

“The formula needs adjustment,” she said. “The duration was wrong, and whatever you experienced in there.” She shook her head. “No. You're right. The plan with Lorren is dead.”  

I should have felt relieved. Part of me did. But a larger part was focused on the wrongness inside my own head, the feeling that something had cracked that I couldn’t see. I found myself pacing again. “If only we could dig through stone. That room is right underneath Mains, not the Archives at all.”  

Devi went very still. “What did you say?”  

“The Archives’ floors rotate,” I said, still half-lost in my own thoughts. “Each sub-level spirals off the one above. Sub-two extends beneath Mains, not straight down. The room behind the Four-Plate Door is under the old courtyard with the apple tree.”  

“Show me,” Devi said.  

I pulled out my notebook, sketching the rotated floors, the measurements, the angles. I watched her understand.  

“You’re certain?” she asked.  

“I triangulated it from six different positions. The math is solid.”  

She went to her desk and began searching through drawers.  

“We don’t need the door at all,” she said.  

“What do you mean?”  

She turned, holding a vial. This one was larger, the liquid inside clear with a faint oily shimmer. Vapor rose from the sealed stopper.  

“We make our own door.” She smiled, hungry. “I was working on this before I got expelled. An acid compound. Slow, patient, relentless. It eats stone the way time eats everything else.” Her expression flickered. “I never got to finish the experiment. The Masters found my notes before I could try it. But I’ve refined the formula since then.”  

“You wanted to dig through the floor of a University building?”  

“I wanted to dig through the ceiling of a hidden room that the University pretends doesn’t exist.” She stepped closer, her voice dropping. “Think about it, Kvothe. Generations of curious minds have accomplished nothing. But no one has tried going around it. No one knew where it actually was.”  

I should have said no. Everything in me knew this was madness. But the door had haunted me for so long. The secrets it hid, the answers it kept. My parents’ killers. The truth about the Chandrian. Everything I’d been chasing since I was eleven years old.  

“How long would it take?” I heard myself ask.  

Devi’s smile widened. “A few spans. Maybe longer. The stone is old and hard. But I can get us through.”  

I thought of Auri’s trusting face. Of Sim and Wil, worried for me. Of Herma, taking a chance on me when I had nowhere else to go.  

I thought of the door with my book locked behind it.  

“Alright,” I said. “Show me.”  

Devi looked triumphant. But I barely noticed. I was too busy trying not to think about the tremor in my hands, the way my Alar had slipped, the darkness I’d glimpsed behind my own eyes.
