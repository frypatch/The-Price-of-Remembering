# CHAPTER 10

## KEYS TO THE PAST  

BREAKING INTO LORREN’S rooms was a terrible idea. Dangerous. Foolish. Likely to end with me thrown from the University like an unwanted book. But what’s one more terrible idea in a life already full of them?  

The real danger wasn’t sneaking into the administrative wing of the Archives. It wasn't slipping through shadows or carefully manipulating the lock on Lorren’s door. Those things were simple mechanics, familiar steps in a dance I’d practiced before. No, the danger came from the tiny vial nestled in my pocket—the one Devi trusted me to test on myself.  

I could still hear her voice, crisp and confident: *“Once you know how it works, we’ll move forward. No surprises.”*  

But surprises were inevitable. Because Devi didn’t need to hear the results of my test—not yet. Lorren would be my unwitting subject. If the vial worked exactly as she promised, I could wring something meaningful from my misstep, finding my own way forward while still keeping her ambitions at bay.  

The night was black as ink as I crept through the Archives’ quiet belly. The hallways swallowed sound, each step pressing into thick silence. Lorren’s door stood like a dark sentinel at the end of the hall, its simplicity concealing the danger it held.  

The lock was old but not primitive, the kind of mechanism designed to outwit impatient fingers. Kneeling, I pulled the leather pouch of my lockpicks from my pocket and worked with practiced care. The tumblers whispered their uncertainties before finally yielding, not with a click, but a sound quieter, softer—a sigh of surrender.  

I eased the door open, slipping into the shadowed space beyond.  

Lorren’s quarters were as stark as his demeanor. A narrow cot stood at perfect right angles to the wall, its sheets crisp and taut as a bowstring. The desk was unadorned, save for a quill resting in such precise stillness that I felt certain he measured its placement nightly. The books lining the walls were arranged immaculately, their spines unbroken, their contents surely marked in some master catalog to ensure none ever shifted out of place. The room was a monument to order, to discipline. And standing in its center, I felt like a stain.  

But I had work to do.  

The water jug on his bedside table was plain pottery, as unpretentious as the man himself, though its placement felt deliberate. Even the slight angle of the drinking cup beside it seemed calculated, as though to test if anyone dared disrupt his routine.  

I drew the vial from my pocket. Devi had assured me it was potent yet subtle—a slipping into sleep so quiet it could fool even its victim. I uncorked it carefully, the tang of alchemy nipping at my nose, sharp and faintly medicinal.  

For a moment, I hesitated. The thought of Lorren drinking from the jug felt like stepping past a line I hadn’t fully admitted existed. But no good story comes without risk. I tipped the vial gently, letting its green shimmer mix into the water. I swirled it with deliberate care, watching the liquid settle into calm transparency, then returned it to its place as if it had never been touched.  

Beneath the cot, the world narrowed. Dust clung to the sharp scent of varnish, the space a stifling, airless bubble. My breath quieted into measured beats as Lorren’s absence stretched into a silence so thick it might have been alive.  

And then, at last, the door creaked open.  

Lorren’s footsteps were deliberate, steady. Not loud, not hurried. The sound of someone who expected his surroundings to obey him. He paused at the bedside, his silhouette cutting across the faint light spilling through the window.  

He poured a cup of water and drank it all in three steady swallows.  

I waited. Not long. The draught worked as advertised—though its subtlety unnerved me. There was no dramatics, no sharp collapse. Just a gradual slowing of motions until Lorren sat on his cot, his body sagging under the weight of sudden sleep. Soon his breathing turned deep and measured, slipping into the natural rhythm of unconsciousness.  

I slid from beneath the cot as quiet as a ghost, my eyes already on the keys around his neck. This next part would test more than my skill—it would test my conscience.  

### * * *

In the end, I couldn't bring myself to do it. And letting go of that greed allowed me to think clearly for the first time in days. The door didn’t guard *knowledge*. It wasn’t a treasure beyond the grasp of lesser minds. It held something simpler: ink and parchment. The physical manifestation of words. If this was what I truly sought, why try to open a locked door when I could bring the words to me?  

Sleep eluded me that night, no matter how I turned or how tightly I closed my eyes. The room was too loud in its silence, and my thoughts moved like wildfire in the dry grass of my mind. A plan bloomed there, hot and insistent, despite the haze of exhaustion.  

When morning came, I stumbled to Devi’s door, bleary-eyed. She answered in kind, her hair untidy, her face pale with the look of broken rest.  

“Well?” she asked, her words cutting through the fog of my thoughts.  

“The dosage was wrong,” I lied. “I woke too early. Lorren will know if we do this.”  

Her expression shifted—somewhere between skepticism and guilt. Perhaps it was that expression, so out of character for her, that made me hesitate before admitting my deeper failure. She insisted on no follow-up questions, almost sheepishly sending me on my way. Curious.  

On my way out of Imre, I bought enough *nahirout* to keep me alert for days. I had work to do.  

### * * *  

A burst of inspiration can feel like magic to a fool. But I have spent enough time under a magician’s hat to know better—it’s not the spark. It’s the hours, the work, the sacrifice. That is the true cost of turning a spark into a flame.  

For seven sleepless days, I lived by that truth. I ate thin food, drank *nahirout* tea in place of water, and drowned myself in the work. My goal was clear: to take the physical edges of ink and make them *move*. Like rubbing charcoal on paper to trace the raised surface of a coin, I would create a sympathy that translated ink from far away to an empty page in my hands.  

When I presented my near-working prototype to Master Kilvin, his silence was worse than rage. He stared at the device, listened as I explained its crude workings, then finally spoke: “Cleverness,” he said, as though the word itself were a warning, “is no substitute for wisdom. Promise me, Kvothe, you won’t tread this road again.”  

He didn’t order it locked away. He didn’t tell me to refine it. He didn’t even ask to test it. He simply melted it into molten slag with the forge bellows. Hot metal, wasted time, failings lost. That night, I stumbled back to my tiny room and collapsed on the floor.  

I slept for two days.
