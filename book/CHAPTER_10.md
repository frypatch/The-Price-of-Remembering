# CHAPTER 10.

## A FOOLISH BARGIN.


I found myself at Devi’s door once more, spent and empty, lacking even the thinnest excuse.  

Perhaps this was her intention. She scattered secrets, leaving clues behind her like breadcrumbs. She led me through the hollow places of my mind, certain I would poke and prod and dwell. Or perhaps it was something simpler, just slow and stubborn exhaustion.  

When Devi opened the door, she barely glanced at me before stepping aside. The scent of cinnamon wrapped around me. Devi’s scent, though I didn’t think of it that way at the time. “Kvothe,” she said, letting my name stretch off her tongue. “Back so soon? People will start to talk if you keep this up.”  

“Let them,” I said as I stepped inside. Devi moved back to her desk. The glint in her eye told me she’d already won.  

“And?” she prompted, waving a hand languidly. “Did you find what you were looking for?”  

“There’s more than you’re telling me,” I blurted. “You know more about what Lorren’s hiding, and you’ve been holding back.”  

Devi tilted her head, her smile cutting sharper. “Sweet Kvothe, that’s a bold accusation. And here I thought we were friends.”  

“Friends don’t play games like this.”  

“Oh, Kvothe, they absolutely do,” she said, leaning back against the edge of her desk. “But friendship doesn’t come cheap. You want to know what Lorren is keeping locked away? Get me into the Archives. Then we’ll talk.”  

“No,” I said. “Not a chance.”  

Devi arched a skeptical brow. “So sudden, so certain. Why not, darling boy? Surely there’s room enough for two clever, hungry minds in your hallowed stacks.”  

“There are places you don’t belong, Devi. Some doors wouldn’t close so cleanly after you passed through them.”  

Her expression didn’t falter, but her fingers drummed slowly against the edge of the desk. “I expected better of you, Kvothe. I really did. I thought you’d understand a simple bargain between civilized people.”  

“We’re not even having this conversation,” I snapped, pacing a short, tight line. “I won’t risk it.”  

“You owe me,” she said quietly. “The reagents. The ones that helped you find what really killed Herma. You asked for my help. I gave it.”  

We argued after that, the words rising sharp and reckless between us. I tried to wield reason like a shield, but Devi cut through it with precision. She was a professional trader of secrets and debts, and I was at best a stubborn apprentice.  

Looking back, I can see how neatly she’d backed me into this corner. But at the time, all I could see was the door I needed opened.  

“Fine,” I said. “But on my terms.”  

Her lips twitched into a smile. “How startlingly reasonable of you. And what, pray tell, are your terms?”  

“No action until we’ve settled on a solid plan. One we both agree on.”  

Devi inclined her head, her fingers resuming their rhythmic tap. “Fair enough,” she said. “Lucky for you, I’ve already given this some thought. We just need to borrow the keys.”  

Then, from her pocket, she produced a small vial no larger than her thumb. The liquid inside caught the lamplight, deep red with a faint shimmer.  

“This,” she said, holding it aloft, “is a little marvel I’ve been tinkering with. Tasteless, odorless, and precise. A few drops in Lorren’s wine, and he’ll sleep deep and dreamless. More importantly, he’ll remember nothing when he wakes.”  

“Borrowing keys and drugging one of the Masters are two very different things.”  

Her smile turned wicked. “You know, Lorren keeps the keys to the Four-Plate Door under his robe with little else. Curious place to tuck something so important, don’t you think?”  

I couldn’t tell if she was implying something darker or simply repeating a rumor. “What are you saying?” I asked carefully.  

Her smile widened. “Nothing, darling. Just facts.”  

“I still don’t like this.”  

“I’d be worried if you did,” Devi said, setting the vial carefully on the corner of her desk. “But unless you’ve got a better plan?”  

I wanted to argue. Everything in me itched to push back. But I didn’t have another plan, and I was desperate enough to take the risk.  

“There’s one more condition. I insist on testing it first. On me.”  

Devi’s sharp laughter filled the room, fading almost as quickly as it began. When she saw my face, her amusement curdled. “You have my assurances. It works.”  

“That won’t do. If it doesn’t work exactly the way you promise, I need to know now.”  

For once, she hesitated. Her free hand curled tight at her side before releasing, and her eyes flicked to the vial.  

“Come back in three days,” she said, every word clipped. “I’ll have everything ready.”  

Neither of us moved. Then she dropped the vial into her pocket and sent me back out into the night.  
  
### * * *

Three days felt like three years.

The first day was unbearable, my thoughts circling endlessly. Vashet’s voice crept into my head, sharp and demanding.

> “Which path lies closer to the Lethani?”  
> “The one that endangers everyone?”  
> “Or the one that preserves what you hold dear?”  

By the second day, it wasn’t Vashet’s voice haunting me but Wil and Sim’s. They cornered me in the dim shade of the Courtyard, their words bouncing off my already fragile resolve.

“People are talking,” Sim said, always too loud. “You’ve been seeing Devi an awful lot lately, you know.”

Wil shot him a glare before turning to me. “This isn’t like you, Kvothe. Do you even know why they expelled her?”

“I heard it was dueling,” I said casually, though the words were thick on my tongue.

“Alchemical experimentation,” Wil said. “Dangerous experimentation. She swore revenge on the Masters after they caught her.”

“And now you’re working with her?” Sim asked, clearly concerned.

I brushed them off with words I couldn’t bring myself to believe.

### * * *

By the evening of the third day, my uncertainty had deepened. Doubt no longer sat quietly in the back of my mind. It had become a living thing, restless and sharp-toothed. It gnawed at me whenever my thoughts wandered near. It moved with me as I walked the winding edges of the Underthing. It waited beside me in the half-light while I sat with my lute across my lap, Auri close enough to touch.

The music I found there was thin and strained. The notes stumbled from my fingers, clumsy and half-remembered. They held none of the shape or easy certainty I found in better moments. Still, Auri listened as she always did. Knees hugged to her chest. Hair tumbling round her shoulders. Her face turned up, pale and patient, like a flower seeking warmth. Her eyes, though, stayed strange and unreadable. She said nothing of the music’s failings. She revealed nothing except in the careful silence that lingered softly between the notes.

“You’re tangled,” she said as the last note faded into the still air. Her voice was soft but certain, as if she could see the snarl of my thoughts laid bare before her.

I ran my fingers lightly over the strings, pretending to tune them. “Just restless,” I said with a thin smile that couldn’t quite find its footing.

Auri tilted her head the other way, her pale hair catching the faintest glimmer of light. “No,” she said simply, her voice the quiet certainty of a secret well kept. “Not restless.”

She unfolded herself with the fluid grace of something quick and wild. For a moment, she hesitated, balancing lightly on the balls of her feet. Then, as if some invisible cue had whispered to her, she stepped away into the shadows, her movements soundless, belonging entirely to the dark world beneath the University.

I stayed where I was for a long time, staring at the weathered stone where her feet had danced moments before. Auri didn’t ask any questions, but just being near her reminded me how much she trusted me. That trust was fragile and fleeting, as delicate as blown glass held in hands that gripped too tightly.

This was why I had to be careful. Why I had to be better. The weight of her unspoken faith, thin as it was, added an unbearable heft to the decisions winding around inside me.

But that night, as I stood and made my way back across the river, I buried those doubts beneath the all-too-familiar tug of my own desires.

### * * *

The closer I got to Devi’s, the more my thoughts twisted. The nervous rhythm of my steps matched the churning in my chest. And yet I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. The archives had loomed before me for so long, locked and unattainable, that the thought of missing this one chance outweighed every hesitation.

I knew I was moving too quickly and trusting too easily. I knew my plan was patched together with fraying threads. But greed has a knack for muting better instincts, and mine whispered sweet lies.

> “This will work.”  
> “You’ll figure it out.”  
> “Devi’s just a means to an end.”  

I knocked on Devi’s door with a resolve that cracked at the edges, but I refused to acknowledge the strain. She opened it quickly, her sharp smile already in place, her eyes alight with purpose.

“Come inside,” she said, her satisfaction dripping from each word.

For a fleeting moment, I hesitated. My mind conjured Auri’s unguarded smile, her weightless laughter twirling through the dark. The delicate trust she placed in me to keep her world safe. Then my thoughts returned to the archives, to the answers just out of reach, and I swallowed my hesitation whole.

Devi stepped aside, and I walked in. Greed pressed me forward, and doubt trailed behind like a shadow I refused to see.

### * * *

Breaking into Lorren’s room was a terrible idea. It was dangerous and foolish, likely to end with me thrown from the University like an unwanted book. Still, what was one more terrible idea in a life already full of them?

The real danger wasn’t sneaking into the administrative wing of the University. It wasn’t slipping through shadows or carefully manipulating the lock on Lorren’s door. Those things were simple mechanics, familiar steps in a dance I’d practiced before. The true threat was the tiny vial nestled in my pocket. Devi trusted me to test it on myself, and that was what worried me most.

I could still hear her voice, crisp and confident.

> “Once you know how it works, we’ll move forward.”  
> “No surprises.”  

But surprises were inevitable. Devi didn’t need to hear the results of my test yet. Instead, Lorren would become my unwitting subject. If the vial worked exactly as she promised, I could gain something meaningful from my mistake. That way, I could find my own path and keep her ambitions at a distance.

The night was black as ink as I crept through the University’s quiet belly. The hallways swallowed sound, each step pressing into thick silence. Lorren’s door stood like a dark sentinel at the end of the hall, its simplicity concealing the danger it held.

The lock was old but not primitive, the kind of mechanism designed to outwit impatient fingers. Kneeling, I pulled the leather pouch of my lockpicks from my pocket and worked with practiced care. The tumblers whispered their uncertainties before finally yielding, not with a click but with a sound even quieter and softer, almost like a sigh of surrender.

I eased the door open, slipping into the shadowed space beyond.

Lorren’s quarters were as stark as his demeanor. A narrow cot stood at perfect right angles to the wall, its sheets crisp and taut as a bowstring. The desk was unadorned, save for a quill resting in such precise stillness that I felt certain he measured its placement nightly. The books lining the walls were arranged immaculately, their spines unbroken, their contents surely marked in some master catalog to ensure none ever shifted out of place. The room was a monument to order, to discipline. And standing in its center, I felt like a stain.

But I had work to do.

The water jug on his bedside table was plain pottery, as unpretentious as the man himself, though its placement felt deliberate. Even the slight angle of the drinking cup beside it seemed calculated, as though to test if anyone dared disrupt his routine.

I drew the vial from my pocket. Devi had assured me it was potent yet subtle, a slipping into sleep so quiet it could fool even its victim. I uncorked it carefully. The tang of alchemy nipped at my nose, sharp and faintly medicinal.

For a moment, I hesitated. The thought of Lorren drinking from the jug felt like stepping past a line I hadn’t fully admitted existed. But no good story comes without risk. I tipped the vial gently, letting its green shimmer mix into the water. I swirled it with deliberate care, watching the liquid settle into calm transparency, then returned it to its place as if it had never been touched.

Beneath the cot, the world narrowed. Dust clung to the sharp scent of varnish, the space a stifling, airless bubble. My breath quieted into measured beats as Lorren’s absence stretched into a silence so thick it might have been alive.

And then, at last, the door creaked open.

Lorren’s footsteps were deliberate, steady. Not loud, not hurried. The sound of someone who expected his surroundings to obey him. He paused at the bedside, his silhouette cutting across the faint light spilling through the window.

He poured a cup of water and drank it all in three steady swallows.

I waited. It didn’t take long. The draught worked as advertised, though its subtlety made me uneasy. There was nothing dramatic, no sharp collapse. Movements slowed gradually until Lorren sat on his cot, his body sagging under the weight of sudden sleep. Soon his breathing became deep and measured, settling into the natural rhythm of unconsciousness.

I slid from beneath the cot as quietly as a ghost, my eyes already on the keys around his neck. What came next would challenge not only my skill but also my conscience.

### * * *

In the end, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Letting go of that greed allowed me to think clearly for the first time in days. The door didn’t guard knowledge or hide some unattainable treasure. Instead, it kept something simpler inside, just ink and parchment, the physical form of words. If this was all I truly wanted, I realized there was no need to open a locked door. I could simply bring the words to me.

Sleep eluded me that night, no matter how I turned or how tightly I closed my eyes. The room was too loud in its silence, and my thoughts moved like wildfire in the dry grass of my mind. A plan bloomed there, hot and insistent, despite the haze of exhaustion.

When morning came, I stumbled to Devi’s door, bleary-eyed. She answered in kind, her hair untidy, her face pale with the look of broken rest.

“Well?” she asked, her words cutting through the fog of my thoughts.

“The dosage was wrong,” I lied. “I woke too early. Lorren will know if we do this.”

Her expression shifted—somewhere between skepticism and guilt. Perhaps it was that expression, so out of character for her, that made me hesitate before admitting my deeper failure. She insisted on no follow-up questions, almost sheepishly sending me on my way. Curious.

On my way out of Imre, I spent a small fortune on enough nahirout to keep me alert for days. I had work to do.

### * * *  

A burst of inspiration can feel like magic to a fool. However, I have spent enough time under a magician’s hat to know better. The spark is not what matters most. What truly counts are the hours, the work, and the sacrifice. That is the real cost of turning a spark into a flame.

For seven sleepless days, I lived by that truth. I ate thin food, drank nahirout tea in place of water, and drowned myself in the work. My goal was clear. I wanted to take the physical edges of ink and make them move. It would be like rubbing charcoal on paper to trace the raised surface of a coin. I would create a sympathy that translated ink from far away onto an empty page in my hands.

When I presented my clumsy prototype to Master Kilvin, his silence was worse than rage. He stared at the device and listened as I explained its crude workings. At last he spoke. “Cleverness,” he said, as though the word itself were a warning, “is no substitute for wisdom. Promise me, Kvothe, you won’t tread this road again.”

He didn’t order it locked away. He didn’t tell me to refine it. He didn’t even ask to test it. He simply melted it into molten slag with the forge bellows. Hot metal, wasted time, failings lost. That night, I stumbled back to my tiny room and collapsed on the floor.

I slept for two days.
