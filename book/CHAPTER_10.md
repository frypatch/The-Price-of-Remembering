# CHAPTER 10.

## KEYS TO THE PAST.


BREAKING INTO LORREN’S rooms was a terrible idea. It was dangerous and foolish, likely to end with me thrown from the University like an unwanted book. Still, what was one more terrible idea in a life already full of them?

The real danger wasn’t sneaking into the administrative wing of the University. It wasn't slipping through shadows or carefully manipulating the lock on Lorren’s door. Those things were simple mechanics, familiar steps in a dance I’d practiced before. The true threat was the tiny vial nestled in my pocket. Devi trusted me to test it on myself, and that was what worried me most.

I could still hear her voice, crisp and confident.

> “Once you know how it works, we’ll move forward.”  
> “No surprises.”  

But surprises were inevitable. Devi didn’t need to hear the results of my test yet. Instead, Lorren would become my unwitting subject. If the vial worked exactly as she promised, I could gain something meaningful from my mistake. That way, I could find my own path and keep her ambitions at a distance.

The night was black as ink as I crept through the University's quiet belly. The hallways swallowed sound, each step pressing into thick silence. Lorren’s door stood like a dark sentinel at the end of the hall, its simplicity concealing the danger it held.

The lock was old but not primitive, the kind of mechanism designed to outwit impatient fingers. Kneeling, I pulled the leather pouch of my lockpicks from my pocket and worked with practiced care. The tumblers whispered their uncertainties before finally yielding, not with a click but with a sound even quieter and softer, almost like a sigh of surrender.

I eased the door open, slipping into the shadowed space beyond.

Lorren’s quarters were as stark as his demeanor. A narrow cot stood at perfect right angles to the wall, its sheets crisp and taut as a bowstring. The desk was unadorned, save for a quill resting in such precise stillness that I felt certain he measured its placement nightly. The books lining the walls were arranged immaculately, their spines unbroken, their contents surely marked in some master catalog to ensure none ever shifted out of place. The room was a monument to order, to discipline. And standing in its center, I felt like a stain.

But I had work to do.

The water jug on his bedside table was plain pottery, as unpretentious as the man himself, though its placement felt deliberate. Even the slight angle of the drinking cup beside it seemed calculated, as though to test if anyone dared disrupt his routine.

I drew the vial from my pocket. Devi had assured me it was potent yet subtle, a slipping into sleep so quiet it could fool even its victim. I uncorked it carefully. The tang of alchemy nipped at my nose, sharp and faintly medicinal.

For a moment, I hesitated. The thought of Lorren drinking from the jug felt like stepping past a line I hadn’t fully admitted existed. But no good story comes without risk. I tipped the vial gently, letting its green shimmer mix into the water. I swirled it with deliberate care, watching the liquid settle into calm transparency, then returned it to its place as if it had never been touched.

Beneath the cot, the world narrowed. Dust clung to the sharp scent of varnish, the space a stifling, airless bubble. My breath quieted into measured beats as Lorren’s absence stretched into a silence so thick it might have been alive.

And then, at last, the door creaked open.

Lorren’s footsteps were deliberate, steady. Not loud, not hurried. The sound of someone who expected his surroundings to obey him. He paused at the bedside, his silhouette cutting across the faint light spilling through the window.

He poured a cup of water and drank it all in three steady swallows.

I waited. It didn’t take long. The draught worked as advertised, though its subtlety made me uneasy. There was nothing dramatic, no sharp collapse. Movements slowed gradually until Lorren sat on his cot, his body sagging under the weight of sudden sleep. Soon his breathing became deep and measured, settling into the natural rhythm of unconsciousness.

I slid from beneath the cot as quietly as a ghost, my eyes already on the keys around his neck. What came next would challenge not only my skill but also my conscience.

In the end, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Letting go of that greed allowed me to think clearly for the first time in days. The door didn’t guard knowledge or hide some unattainable treasure. Instead, it kept something simpler inside, just ink and parchment, the physical form of words. If this was all I truly wanted, I realized there was no need to open a locked door. I could simply bring the words to me.

Sleep eluded me that night, no matter how I turned or how tightly I closed my eyes. The room was too loud in its silence, and my thoughts moved like wildfire in the dry grass of my mind. A plan bloomed there, hot and insistent, despite the haze of exhaustion.

When morning came, I stumbled to Devi’s door, bleary-eyed. She answered in kind, her hair untidy, her face pale with the look of broken rest.

“Well?” she asked, her words cutting through the fog of my thoughts.

“The dosage was wrong,” I lied. “I woke too early. Lorren will know if we do this.”

Her expression shifted—somewhere between skepticism and guilt. Perhaps it was that expression, so out of character for her, that made me hesitate before admitting my deeper failure. She insisted on no follow-up questions, almost sheepishly sending me on my way. Curious.

On my way out of Imre, I spent a small fortune on enough nahirout to keep me alert for days. I had work to do.

### * * *  

A burst of inspiration can feel like magic to a fool. However, I have spent enough time under a magician’s hat to know better. The spark is not what matters most. What truly counts are the hours, the work, and the sacrifice. That is the real cost of turning a spark into a flame.

For seven sleepless days, I lived by that truth. I ate thin food, drank nahirout tea in place of water, and drowned myself in the work. My goal was clear. I wanted to take the physical edges of ink and make them move. It would be like rubbing charcoal on paper to trace the raised surface of a coin. I would create a sympathy that translated ink from far away onto an empty page in my hands.

When I presented my clumsy prototype to Master Kilvin, his silence was worse than rage. He stared at the device and listened as I explained its crude workings. At last he spoke. “Cleverness,” he said, as though the word itself were a warning, “is no substitute for wisdom. Promise me, Kvothe, you won’t tread this road again.”

He didn’t order it locked away. He didn’t tell me to refine it. He didn’t even ask to test it. He simply melted it into molten slag with the forge bellows. Hot metal, wasted time, failings lost. That night, I stumbled back to my tiny room and collapsed on the floor.

I slept for two days.
