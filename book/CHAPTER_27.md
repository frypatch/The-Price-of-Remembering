# CHAPTER 27.

## OLD ACQUAINTANCES.


THE GATES OF Severen opened slowly.

Inside, the city was not loud. Yet it complained with unrest. Soldiers gathered in knots outside taverns. Wagons rattled and bowed low along the cobblestones. Proclamations fluttered from doorposts, thin and papery, like the brittle skins of trees long dead.

After we stabled the horses, Denna and I parted. A word. A glance. An understanding. We would meet again, when nighttime turned the city to gold.

After we stabled the horses, Denna and I parted. A word. A glance. An unspoken promise to meet again when evening fell.

I was not sure how I would gain the Maer’s attention. I had the shape of a plan, nothing more. It turned out, I did not need one. Before the dust of Denna’s leaving had settled, I showed Stapes’s letter. And then Dagon appeared. Broad, silent. Eyes cold and sharp as frost. He led me through winding halls, the hush of stone on stone, until I stood before the Maer.

Alveron sat alone at his desk. The surface sprawled with documents, with scrolls, with Stapes’s crumpled letter. Fire from the hearth turned the walls the color of autumn. The Maer regarded me, lambent-eyed and unreadable.

A flicker of calculation danced among the flames.

“Ah, Kvothe, do come in,” Alveron said, still hale and healthy, I noted.

“Your grace,” I said, bowing low and formal. “You seem well.”

“I am,” he replied tersely. “I must say your presence is most unexpected. Shouldn’t you be in Imre, drawing on that extortionate tuition they demand of me.” He said icily, before picking up one of the many pieces of parchment from atop his desk, “I’m to understand Stapes gave you this letter, though it fails to say as to why.”

“That is true, your grace. I come bearing troubling news that warrants your immediate attention,” I replied.

“Is Meluan safe?” Alveron said, springing halfway out of his seat. More concern in his voice than I’d ever heard from him before.

“She is your grace, though given what I have to tell you, you may wish to take action,” I said.

He seemed to relax a little, settling back in his chaw. “This news, it must be serious indeed to bring you all the way here. Speak plainly, though do so quickly. The hour grows late, and I have pressing matters of my own to attend to.”

“I have heard word of a coup coming to Renere,” I said. “With Regent Fascino at the center, your grace.”

He raised an eyebrow. His face was all unreadable lines and old patience. “You have news, do you? How did such news find its way to you?”

“Regent Lugosi,” I answered.

He made a small sound, something that might have been a laugh if one was generous. He leaned back, rubbing his hands together in the firelight. “One regent, whispering sharp words about another. It never ends.”

I hesitated before speaking. “Forgive me, your grace, but you seem less troubled than I’d expected.”

“Trouble at my borders is always my concern.” He paused, then corrected himself. “What of Roderick? Has this reached his ear?”

“I cannot say.” A click in my throat as I swallowed. “His inner circle is insulated. Regent Lugosi has plans to warn him, but I left before they could take shape. We both worry he will not see the danger. Not soon enough.”

He smiled then, slow as frost on a windowpane. “If Roderick truly listens, the whispers will find him. I suppose we can all sleep soundly, for a while.”

“Will you send word?” I pressed. “Will you move to reinforce the capital?”

At once, I knew I had asked too much. I felt it in the hush that followed, in the way his eyes weighed me, weighed all that I was not saying.

“And why would I do such a thing?” he said, tone brimming with disapproval. “I didn’t see Roderick ride out when bandits assailed the King’s road or for any of the disturbances in the north. The bastard demands his tithes and then comes crawling to me when he can not secure his own lands. For what possible reason would I risk coming to his aid?”

I took a moment to muster all my powers of persuasion. “Your grace, if Roderick is unseated, it will throw the region into turmoil. Any agitation could very well spill over into your own lands.” Another thought came to me. “Also, should the worst arise, and you are the one who rides to his aid, Roderick would be very much in your debt.”

Looking into the fire, his features fixed in contemplation, Alveron appeared to ponder this a moment. “You were wise to bring this to me, Kvothe,” he said, seeming to come to a decision. “I will consider what you have said. I am due in the capital for his daughter’s wedding in the coming days. Perhaps I shall expand my retinue accordingly,” Alveron added, eying me shrewdly.

Sensing that there was nothing more to say on the matter, I bowed, making it to the door before he called me back.

“Wait. Keep this matter between us for the time being until I’ve had sufficient time to investigate the validity of these claims. Stories such as this carry the potential to cause considerable unrest if not handled appropriately, wouldn’t you agree?”

I nodded. “As you wish, your grace.”

### * * *

Outside the Maer’s chambers, Dagon was waiting. He stood silent as stone, his one good eye turning to me as I pulled the door closed behind me. He did not speak. He only nodded, then set off down the hall. I followed.

We had not gone far. The marble still remembered the warmth of the day beneath our feet, and I drifted in my thoughts, half-awake, half-dreaming. Then a ripple of strangeness caught my eye. Something here had shifted. Something small, but out of place.

On the wall between two tall windows, a painting stood. It rose taller than any man. Its gilded frame caught the light, holding it quiet and close. The paint was the work of a master’s hand, the brushstrokes deft and sure, bringing to life the likeness of a woman not yet old. She looked out from the canvas with eyes I knew. Eyes I had seen in the mirror.

Dagon was already two steps ahead, but he must have seen my gaze.

“Lady Meluan’s mother. Anastasia Lackless. They hung it when her ladyship moved in.”

The name barely touched me. I stood staring at the hollow place behind my ribs.

It wasn’t just resemblance. It was recognition. The curve of her cheek, proud and sharp as song. The angle of her jaw, the rare clarity of her gray-green eyes, just as they’d gleamed above an old lute once on a summer afternoon. Those were my mother’s eyes.

No. Not my mother’s.

Natalia Lackless.

The old rhyme fluttered through me unbidden.

“Seven things stand before the entrance to the Lackless door.”

I had learned it in jest, recited as a child in whispers, back when I still thought stories were nothing more than clever lies we gave to truth to make it go down easier.

I remembered her voice telling me tales by firelight. Her laughter at my first attempts to play the lute. Her silence whenever I asked about grandparents, or cousins, or names older than hers.

She had kept it from me. The truth. The name. The legacy.

In that moment, I understood why a song can hurt more than a sword.

I had starved in Tarbean. Slept in alleys like a kicked dog, foraging words like scraps from the mouths of richer men.

And across the map, behind silk curtains and carved stone, a family I never knew had buried me with their silence. A sister denied. A child erased.

I felt my vision narrow. It was not quite fury, not yet. But something sharper took hold. It was more precise than anger, like wonder that had turned bitter in the mouth.

If they knew, what would they do with me?

Would the Maer send for a knife in the night, not to silence a threat but to erase a shame? Would Meluan look at me and see her own sister’s sin dragged through the mud, strung up in street colors and Ruh silk?

I touched the bone ring at my finger. White. Promise-bound. Unbroken.

In a different world, it might have been a signet. In this one, it was a gravestone.

Behind me, Dagon cleared his throat. “Don’t make me drag you out.”

But I stayed another blink longer, just long enough to whisper the name, “Lackless,” before turning away.

“Tell me, why do you serve the Maer?” I asked him as we walked.

“His grace is a man of prominence,” he replied without hesitation.

“And yet, for all we do for him, he still looks down on us. We are just tools for them to use and discard,” I said bitterly.

He shrugged. “We each have our roles to play. This is mine. When the Maer offers the carrot and it fails, I’m the stick.”

I stopped in my tracks, unable to suppress the laughter bubbling up inside me. My conversation with the Cthaeh played in my head. I could see Dagon’s irritation reaching a tipping point, the stoic commander reaching for the wooden cudgel at his waist. But before he could pull it free, I held up my palms in an appeal for calm.

“Tell me, Dagon. How is the road to Tinue these days?”

He paused by the smallest margin. Not the sort of pause you’d notice if you weren’t watching. But I was. His boots lost a breath’s rhythm. His good eye shifted toward me, unreadable.

He said nothing for a long moment. Then he spoke, voice steady. “Long for those who walk the path, and know the way.” It was the very phrase I had pulled from behind the Four-Plate Door.

I turned toward him, letting silence draw out like a string pulled taut.

Then he added, “I heard that in a play once.”

“So did I,” I said, my voice too calm, too quiet. “A very old one. Never staged anymore.”

Dagon turned a corner, gesturing for a pair of minor guards to keep their distance. Then he looked at me properly for the first time, sharply.

“Who taught you that line?” he asked.

“I read it,” I said, watching his eyes. “In a book no one admits exists.”

“A dangerous pastime,” he muttered. “Pages are more patient than people. They don’t know when to keep things buried.”

“I’ve buried things,” I said. “Some that still bleed.”

He considered that in silence. We passed a tall window, and colored light fell across his profile. His features were stern and uncertain, the look of someone marked by a war-scar that would never fully heal.

“If this is a test,” he said at last, “you’re pressing thin ice. The kind of thin that cuts.”

“I’m not testing you,” I said. “I just want to know if what I’ve found belong to anything real.”

Slowly, he nodded once. “Then give me the next line.”

I let the breath hitch in my throat, but I answered.

“And those who do?”

He made a noise like a laugh, but it wasn’t humor. “They do not often return by the same way.”

Silence stretched between us like a drawn bowstring.

I risked more.

“But for those who walk the path,” I said, “and know the way.”

He stopped.

Not blocked the corridor. Not turned.

He merely stopped.

Weight shifted in his shoulders. Breath drawn. The kind of stillness that soldiers learn before drawing steel.

His fingers brushed his cudgel. Not in threat. In readying.

“No more riddles,” he said. “Say what you mean, or say nothing.”

I swallowed. My heart ticked like a counting clock against my ribs.

Then one more gamble.

“For the greater good,” I said.

No flourish. No reverence. I let the words fall like coin on a table.

His eyes searched mine, for what, I don’t know.

Then he echoed it, equally flat, equally exact.

“For the greater good.”

A silence followed.

Then he spoke, his voice balanced delicately between curiosity and caution. “Some of those lines were burnt from doctrine nearly two centuries ago. You’d lose a tongue for half of it.”

“I didn’t take an oath,” I said, “but the cost?” I tapped the bone ring on my finger without a word. “Paid in full.”

Another beat of silence.

At last, Dagon’s gaze shifted beyond me, lingering on stone arches and closed doors. He stepped forward, and half of his form melted into the shadow.

“There’s a town,” he murmured. “Obscure. Cold. Frozen out of memory by newer roads. Leveritis.”

The name rang faint, like a page half-torn from a childhood atlas.

“A tavern,” he continued. “The Weeping Eye. Don’t ask after shelter. Don’t flash coin. Just order finger tea. Then ask for Claude. That’s all.”

My mouth was suddenly dry. “And who is that?”

“No more,” he snapped, quickly. “I’ve already said too much. If I’m wrong about you, I’ll end up with a knife in the gut and my life rewritten in a footnote.” He adjusted his gloves.

Then, as if nothing had passed between us at all, he added brightly. The cheer in his voice was forced, almost blinding in its intensity.

“Of course, it’s all just lines from a bad play.”

I met his eye. “Of course.”

We resumed our walk, both of us quieter than before.

Stories, you see, live in whispers. But some whispers are wearing armor.

### * * *

“How did it go?” Denna asked, casually waiting for me beyond the main gates of the Maer’s estate. “I’m guessing from your expression not well.”

“Alveron’s not going to offer any aid to Roderick,” I said.

Though he hadn’t stated as much directly, I had spent enough time in the man’s company to get a sense of his character, and my instincts told me he had no intention of helping.

“Ah, what now then, do we ride back to Renere?”

“Not yet,” I said, turning back to stare at Alveron’s residence. “I need to go north, but before that there’s one more thing I need to do here.” 

### * * *

The Maer’s estate stretched out beneath the moon. Stone walls lay quiet, windows shuttered like sleeping eyes, but there was tension beneath the silence, waiting. Above, thin clouds floated in silver layers, as gentle as cloth drawn over a restless face, veiling the towers and making them strange. I crouched atop the slant of a merchant’s roof, so near the gardens I could taste the cool dark. From there I watched the patrols move, slow as heartbeats, regular as breath, pulsing beneath scattered patches of stitched-together light. Lanterns drew careful lines along the walkways, each flame precise, too precise for decoration. These were the watchers’ paths. The careful thread of their steps, woven night after night.

It looked different than I remembered. Not simply fortified, but alert. Awake in the way animals are when sensing weather before men can spot it.

I had told Alveron the truth. Or just enough of it not to trip the wire.

But the trouble with truth is that it’s rarely whole. And the things that truly matter don’t live in letters read aloud in the glow of a hearth. They live behind silences. In the things a man won’t say, not even to himself.

I couldn’t walk back in and ask the Maer to unhook a portrait and show me what lay behind it. I couldn’t afford to admit I’d come not just with nation-saving tidings, but for something far smaller, and older, and unforgivably personal.

There are things men will never show you. Not even when they shake your hand. Not even when they pretend to forgive. Not even over wine.

So I planned my own kind of courtesy. Not the kind that knocks at the front door, but the kind that climbs ivy and travels quiet beneath windows. The kind you’re never meant to see.

I tapped the slate beside me gently. Once, twice. A signal. Faint but deliberate.

At the treeline below, Denna shifted just enough for her shadow to shift back. She wouldn’t interfere unless something went wrong. I didn’t say as much when I asked her to wait, but she knew. Denna always knew the things I didn’t want to spell aloud.

I adjusted my shaed, kissed my fingertips, and began to descend.

The outer wall curved treacherously, an old Selic trick meant to befoul ladders. But I didn’t bring a ladder. What I had was a memory’s worth of footholds indenting the stone and fingers calloused by lute strings and harder things.

At the foot of the wall, I crouched beside an old ivy root curled like a dried serpent along the foundation. My hand moved to the right, parting brush. The blue thread I’d left hours earlier remained untouched, taut, and silent. That was good. It meant no patrol had disturbed this stretch since moonrise.

I steadied myself and climbed.

The climb proved slower than the last. Rain had drifted through less than a day before, leaving the moss slick and fragrant in its wake. Halfway up I nearly lost my grip on a loose stone, catching myself just in time by digging my fingertips into a fault-line knot. An old splinter buried itself beneath a nail, and I bit back a yelp as the pain flared sharp and sudden.

I reached the ledge with my pulse stamping sharp in my ears.

Then I saw it.

A glyph. Freshly scored into the underside of the eastward parapet.

It pulsed faintly, like amber eyes hiding in ash. There was no glow to betray it from a distance, yet near at hand, the edge shimmered with the subtle luster of breathing glass. A ward. Crude, but active. Likely tied to alerting a nearby scrying node or sympathist bell.

I cursed silently.

Reaching into my travel satchel, I drew out a tight-wrapped twist of copper ribbon and a cloth pouch of cider ash. I let my breath settle into a slow and steady rhythm, each inhale and exhale shaped by lessons learned in corners of the University too dangerous to name aloud. These were not tools. In my hands, they became promises. I whispered a shape to the ash, holding back the full weight of a name. Instead, I offered only a hint, folded inside a single syllable meant to cool the listening wind around the trigger.

The shimmer in the glyph slowed. Then stopped.

I didn’t move. Not immediately. These things needed to believe you were gone before they looked away.

Several heartbeats later, I stepped gently past it. It didn’t stir.

I let out a breath and slid beneath the wall’s lip.

Below me, the courtyard opened wide, a tongue nestled between twin rows of teeth. Guards drifted along their routine circuits, their movements seeming looser than they truly were. They moved with a studied ease, laughing softly at stories told just for company, yet their eyes swept the space too often for it to be boredom.

Plan A had been the servant’s chute in the west kitchen. The one left untouched since the Maer’s gout soured his appetite for anything but boiled eggs. But that path had been sealed. Bricked over. Forgotten. Plan B was the garden arch by the reflecting pool, where the ivy softened the world and the water waited for company. And Plan C?

I didn’t like thinking in letters beyond B.

I waited for the guard rounds to stagger, dropped to the sculpted trellis with the weight of a breath, and slipped toward the servant’s sub-wing.

Almost.

A glimmer caught my eye.

Another glyph. This one layered beneath a peeling section of paint near the molding.

Sloppier than the last.

But as I ducked beneath it, a gust of wind caught the trailing corner of my shaed and fluttered the edges against the molding.

A flash.

Damn.

I threw myself flat, heart ramming my ribs like a stuck cartwheel. A split-second delay, then a chime. Light, brittle, and not far off. A bell signal. Silent to most. Not to whom it mattered.

They would search this wing. Maybe not immediately. But soon.

No more delays.

I ducked into the first alcove I could find, nearly tripping over a crate of polished pewter. The room was narrow and unlit, lined with piles of linen. I pulled a cloth over myself, crouched behind a wardrobe, and forced my breathing down to a whisper.

Footsteps. Just one pair at first. Then another.

From the sounds, they weren’t on high alert. Still, someone would check. I had only a few minutes. If they checked systematically, I could count on three. If miracles favored me today, perhaps five.

I moved. Fast and quiet. I was no longer a drifting shadow. I had become a thread drawn taut.

The servant hallway smelled of soaproot and tallow, heavier than I remembered. Someone had cleaned thoroughly. I kept to the shadows I knew by name and dodged the brushing threads meant to track presence.

The passage behind the grapevine carving gave way more easily than I expected, whether from luck or from gradual disrepair. I stepped forward, entering the memory of the Maer’s chambers.

It had changed. Not by much. Just enough to feel brittle. It was as if someone had moved things only to set them back in place, arranged so carefully they gave the illusion nothing had shifted at all.

It was hard to tell if it had been done for comfort or for control.

In either case, I had no time to linger in wonder. I paid no attention to the Maer’s collection of jewel-inlaid cases, nor to the bone-inlaid music box that seemed to simper in the corner, nor to the combs fashioned from ivory teeth. I made my way directly to the portrait of Anastasia.

Not just my blood. A gatekeeper.

Carefully, I tilted it aside.

I expected the alcove.

What I didn’t expect was a copper filament unwinding from inside the panel. It pulsed red as it emerged, bright and alive in the dimness.

Breath catching in my throat, I reached in and twisted it taut, murmuring a soft binding, tempting the filament to close the loop instead of completing it. My fingers shook. The pressure on the syl bindings across my chest twitched. If I failed, I would glow like a bonfire to the eyes that listened through copper eyes and silver domes.

It held.

Barely.

I coaxed the panel open and found the box.

Yilish script curled along its edge like laughter caught mid-song.

I didn’t pause.

Didn’t wonder.

Didn’t hope.

I stole it. 

### * * *

Dawn brushed the horizon as Denna and I rode north. The box rested in my pack, its presence a quiet itch I couldn’t ignore.  

“Denna,” I said, breaking the rhythm of hoofbeats. I pulled out the box and handed it to her, watching as curiosity lit her face.  

“Oh, this is lovely,” she murmured, fingers brushing its carved surface. “Ruah, perhaps?”  

“Maybe. But I’m hoping you’ll tell me what you make of it.”  

She hefted it in one hand, giving it a cautious shake. A soft sound stirred inside, a clink that made her brow furrow. “There’s something inside. Stone, perhaps? Oh, these are Yilish knots.” She ran her fingers over the carvings, her expression sharpening.  

“Kist and crayle!” I said, barely stopping my horse from bolting at my outburst. “I thought so too. I’ve been studying it all night, but the meaning escapes me.”  

Denna’s touch lingered on the box. “It’s old, expertly made. I’ve never seen anything this intricate.” She frowned slightly, as though something about it unsettled her. “Where did you get it?”  

“An aunt,” I said, avoiding her gaze.  

“Keep your secrets, then,” she teased with a small smile, though her attention quickly returned to the box.  

I gave her a moment, the silence stretching until I couldn’t bear it. “Well?”  

“Well what?” she replied, looking up with deliberate innocence.  

“What does it say?”  

She smirked. “Words. Riddles. But deciphering them will take time. And impossible while riding a horse.”  

“Fair enough,” I murmured, hesitating as she glanced at me.  

“May I hold onto it?” she asked.  

I swallowed the instinct to refuse. If not Denna, then who? “Just make sure you return it.”  

“When have I ever not?” she said with a smile too bright to trust fully.  

I forced a smile of my own, though we both pretended not to notice the sting of the lie hanging between us.
