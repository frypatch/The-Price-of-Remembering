# CHAPTER 20

## LURED INTO THE CURRENT  

THE PALAZZO DE CONTRAIER did not demand attention the way the White Citadel did. It wasn’t ostentatious or desperate to impress. It didn’t reach for gold or jeweled embellishments like a noble fumbling for titles.  

Instead, it was quiet about its wealth. The mahogany walls were polished the way only old money polishes things—without thinking about it. Rugs thick as river moss softened footfalls, and the travertine tile drank the light, leaving the whole place soaked in quiet. In the corners, statues of unknown figures lingered mid-stride, caught in some silent moment of elegance.  

I moved carefully, smoothing the deep green waistcoat I’d bought for the occasion. It cost too much. It felt too much—too fine, too fitted. But better to wince at the expense than stand out as an obvious intruder.  

Then the half-harp found me.  

It lilted through the grand halls, running fingers along the ribs of the palace, seeking. It knew where it wanted to go. It led me, and I followed.  

Then I saw her.  

Denna.  

She sat straight-backed, fingers precise against the strings, her head tilted slightly. The harp bowed to her, yielding something delicate yet unyielding.  

She met my eyes near the final refrain. A flicker of recognition. Her fingers faltered. Just for a moment, just enough for me to hear.  

The song ended to polite, undeserved applause.  

The murmur of conversation rose again—meaningless talk, gilded courtesies. But Denna’s eyes lingered on mine.  

There was a pause before she crossed the room to me. A hesitation, a decision made.  

Then she embraced me lightly—more the idea of an embrace than the true thing. "Well, aren't we making a habit of this?"  

But I caught the meaning beneath her words: **There you are. I wasn’t sure if I should be looking for you anymore.**  

I exhaled. "You know me, always lurking where I shouldn't be."  

Denna leaned in slightly, her voice silk-soft and dangerous in that way only she could manage. "Yes. Especially with the wrong women, I hear."  

I blinked. "The… wrong—?"  

Denna gave me a knowing look. "Rumors travel fast, Kvothe. And yours are particularly juicy."  

She was amused. Not hurt. But something deeper sat beneath it—a pointed curiosity.  

"We weren’t—" I started, then stopped. What was I supposed to say? That I’d spent sleepless weeks with Devi not tangled in bedsheets but tangled in artificing schematics? That our relationship had been ink-blotted diagrams, alchemical failures, and whispered defiance—nothing more?  

That sort of answer would only make it sound more suspicious. I could already picture the way Denna would tilt her head, the amused glint in her eye. **Oh, of course, Kvothe. Weeks alone with a pretty girl, deep in your work. Definitely just artificing.**  

She was watching me now, dark-eyed and unreadable, waiting.  

I exhaled. "You wound me, Denna," I said smoothly. "To think you believed I'd betray my boundless devotion to you with an alchemist. No offense to alchemists."  

Denna laughed, full and warm. "Ah, see—now that sounds like a lie."  

"Only if you don't believe in poetry," I said.  

Her smile lingered, indulgent. "I don't," she admitted, amused.  

"Then I’ll have to prove you wrong another time," I said, offering the lifeline to pull us away from dangerous waters.  

Denna considered me for a beat longer than necessary—then took the escape.  

"Of course," she murmured, studying me briefly before turning her head toward a rustle at the entrance. Something shifted in her posture—barely, but enough for me to read unease even as it disappeared.  

“Ah,” she said lightly, too lightly. “Fascino has arrived.”  

She exhaled quietly, looking back at me. "I can't linger," she said after a brief hesitation, then, softer: "Stay. I'll show you my favorite part of Renere."  

Then she was gone, slipping into the crowd, and for a moment—so was my grasp on what I’d meant to do.  

### * * *

I noticed Bredon before he noticed me.  

Or rather, I noticed him noticing me.  

He sat among the watchers, the old-money men whose business was not business but influence. He wasn’t near Fascino, nor was he near the lesser lords of Renere.  

Instead, he occupied the perfect corner—a place to see but not be seen. A man who measured the weight of a room before deciding whether to tip the scales.  

His silver-threaded attire would have marked him as some merchant prince if not for the cane that rested against the crook of his arm, its handle set with mother-of-pearl. Not gaudy, but old. A thing passed down.  

Bredon watched the way a man watches a game he has already decided the outcome of.  

And—perhaps it was my imagination—when my eyes met his, I could have sworn I saw the faintest flicker of amusement.  

I moved toward him, careful, deliberate.  

Then came the crash.  

A sudden bloom of red across my new green waistcoat, the sharp scent of wine spilling between fabric and silk.  

The man who had backed into me turned, blinking down at his stained orange coat.  

He didn’t look embarrassed.  

He was older than me, broad-shouldered with the easy posture of high nobility. His coat was of Aturan cut, his insignia woven in gold thread at the cuff.  

His accent, when he spoke, was Aturan as well—drawling, rich, and unimpressed.  

“Watch where you're going," he said, his voice just a shade too loud.  

I wiped at the stain. An accident, I told myself. Play it off. Walk away.  

I brushed a hand over my waistcoat and gave a small, apologetic shrug.  

“Tragic,” I said lightly, tilting my head at his ruined sleeve. "Killed mid-vintage. A true loss."  

I moved to walk around him. He stepped sideways—not blocking me outright, just enough to make the movement feel deliberate.  

“You’ll apologize,” he said smoothly. “Or perhaps you'd prefer satisfaction instead?"  

I let out a slow breath. Ah. Of course.  

I didn’t even know his name, and already we were speaking the language of knives.  

“Satisfaction,” I said lightly, shaking my sleeve, “is a bit dramatic for an overturned drink."  

At the edge of my periphery, I saw Fascino watching. Not approaching. Not helping.  

“And there it is,” he sighed, feigning long-suffering patience as he gave a small shake of his head. His orange coat caught the gold chandelier light as he turned ever-so-slightly to display me to the others.  

"The glib tongue of a Ruh, sneering at civility itself."  

More guests began to look our way. I could feel the room tilt against me so I tensed, fists balled, but made no move to answer. I had suffered worse insults without lifting a hand. If I reacted, I was lost.  

Then, the man moved.  

His foot slid back too quickly—his movement exaggerated just enough. His body twisted at exactly the wrong moment, his weight shifting as if he’d been shoved.  

He staggered. His heel caught. The tray of a passing servant was upended in a fast, crashing sound—broken glass cascading against stone.  

Gasps spread across the room like ripples.  

I didn’t react immediately. I hadn’t touched him. I knew I hadn’t touched him. But that didn’t matter, did it?  

Because the guests hadn’t seen what hadn’t happened.  

They had seen something else.  

The man adjusted his sleeve, exhaling sharply, steadying himself like a man struggling to contain his temper.  

“I try to excuse your vulgarity,” he said gravely, “and you respond with threats of violence?”  

The weight of the room shifted fully against me.  

I stepped forward, finally recognizing the shape of what was happening—but too late.  

Then, at the perfect moment, Fascino arrived.  

"Come now, gentlemen," he said pleasantly, sliding into place like oil over water. His tone was mild, amused, perfectly timed.  

Then, with the measured ease of a practiced hand laying down the final card in a fixed game, he spoke.  

"Lord Vatis, Kvothe, surely there are better ways to settle disagreements?"  

The world paused.  

I could almost hear the pieces clicking into place.  

Vatis is a lord.  

Not just a wealthy merchant. Not a petty court dandy. A lord.  

And there it was.  

I had known the moment smelled of a setup.  

I had simply been too slow to name the players.  

I could feel the weight of expectation around me. The gathered nobles weren’t asking if I would accept. They were waiting for it.  

The story had already been written.  

Vatis turned toward the crowd, his voice crisp with the well-trained projection of a poet on stage.  

“Since this man seems to have forgotten his manners,” he said, clasping his hands behind his back, “perhaps I should remind him how things are settled among gentlemen.”  

Polite laughter.  

Then, smoothly, without raising his voice, without a hint of hesitation:  

“A duel, then.”  

He let the words linger in the air, offering them to the room as if they had been inevitable from the start.  

Gasps rippled outward and calcified into expectation.  

I could deny it. I could argue, protest. But no one in this room would unsee what they thought they had witnessed.  

A lord had been attacked—or at least, something close enough to count.  

If I refused the duel, I was a coward. A dangerous, out-of-control Ruh given a second chance by tuition and charity.  

If I accepted, I was playing noble games on noble ground.  

I had already lost.  

Fascino still said nothing. He didn’t need to.  

I glanced toward him, searching his face for any sign of hesitation, amusement, calculation. But he merely adjusted his cuff.  

With that single, carefully timed gesture, I understood.  

This was never about the duel.  

It was about making sure I had no way to refuse.  

Vatis arched an eyebrow, his expectant smile leaving just enough room for my words.  

I let out a long breath, already regretting my next ones.  

"I accept."  

The room exhaled as one, their tension breaking like a fever.  

Vatis inclined his head, his grin widening.  

Like a man who had orchestrated the whole evening before the wine was even poured.  

### * * *

Bredon found me watching them.

Vatis and Fascino, moving through the room toward the gilded halls beyond.

They weren’t hasty. That was what unsettled me.

"Your knack for catastrophe is truly unparalleled," Bredon murmured beside me. "One might almost believe it divinely ordained."

“I do my best,” I said, voice dry. “For the greater good, you understand.”

Bredon exhaled through his nose, tipping his cane against the marble. It made a quiet, measured sound.

“No one ever starts these things, Kvothe," he said. "They simply... drift into them, like leaves on a river.”

A quiet statement, almost mild, but I felt the weight of it.

Then came the tap of his cane against the floor—once, twice, soft as punctuation.

“But you, my dear boy," he mused, "seem to make a habit of gravitating toward waterfalls.”

I huffed a tired laugh, the closest I had come to smiling all evening.

Bredon studied me for a long moment. Then, just as light, just as casual:

“You do realize your opponent is a poet?"

I blinked. “Oh?”

“Terrible at it,” he added. “Though courtly decorum ensures he will never know.”

Something about the sheer casual disdain in his voice nearly made me smile for real.

Bredon tilted his head, tapping his cane again, as if considering something from a different angle. "He fancies himself an actor as well."

I went still.

“Oh yes,” Bredon continued, watching the door where Vatis had vanished. “Tragic roles, mostly. The suffering noble. The wronged heir." His cane made another quiet tap against the marble. "His falls could use some work, though.”

The words landed, soft as snowfall.

"You could have led with that."

Bredon gave me the smallest, most indulgent smile. "Should I have?"

Before I could answer, Bredon shifted his attention to another figure lingering nearby.

"Ah," he said smoothly. "But we’re being rude. Kvothe, allow me to introduce Prince Trenati."

“Prince Trenati?” I asked, studying him. “As in Roderic’s youngest?”

Trenati inclined his head, smiling with the restrained amusement of someone accustomed to being recognized.

“One and the same,” he said. “I was eager to meet you. My sister speaks well of you. She says you helped her in Imre.”

“She helped me just as much,” I admitted. “It was mutual.”

Trenati shifted ever so slightly, positioning himself casually near the back of the chamber.

There, against the far wall, a steward stood with idle precision—one of those men who didn’t speak unless spoken to. A ledger sat upon his polished oak desk: the kind used for quiet accountings, for marking names not meant to be announced aloud.

I knew that type of desk.

Trenati loosened the fingers of his left glove, rolling them absently between his fingertips.

Then, with an ease that made it seem unimportant, he pulled the glove off and held it in his right hand just as the steward glanced downward.

No words passed between them.

No grand gesture, no notes exchanged.

The steward simply nodded once, as if acknowledging something entirely mundane, and then continued his work.

Before I could think further, Trenati slipped his glove gracefully back onto his fingers, as fluid as water running through an open hand. It was natural, unhurried. A gesture done as subtly as breathing.

And yet—it had been a signal.

For what, I did not yet know.

Had it been a mistake?

No.

This was not accident. Not error.

This was something else.

Tap. Tap.

Bredon’s cane touched the marble beside me. A small, idle sound.

Too casual to be formal.

Too precise to be idle.

But Bredon made no move to acknowledge anything else. Instead, he studied Trenati for a long, thoughtful moment before turning back to me, polite as ever.

Trenati gave no sign that he noticed Bredon. His gaze returned to me, “I saw your altercation with Lord Vatis.”

I let out a slow breath. “Did you?”

He nodded, eyes bright with something unreadable.

“Most wouldn’t have taken the duel, you know.” A pause, measured. “Honor is… harder to find these days.”

Not quite the sort of flattery I enjoyed. If anything, it only confirmed the depth of what I had stepped into.

“Oh?” I asked cautiously.

Trenati inclined his head. “I remember when Vatis dueled Captain Hostenner. Over some slight about his wife. A brutal affair—I hear the captain may be able to ride again someday.”

I gave him a slow, unreadable look. “I would hope he’s recovering well, then.” A vague, neutral platitude. Not too interested. Not too indifferent. But Trenati was watching my reaction closely. Too closely.

Bredon let out a quiet sigh, adjusting the cuff of his sleeve. “From what I understand,” he murmured, “Lord Vatis has been a fixture at court for years. He and Baron Jakis go back some ways.”

I did not react outwardly. Inside, though, I felt the last pieces of the evening settle into place.

Ambrose's father had set the board. Vatis was his piece. And Fascino...

Fascino had simply walked the lamb to slaughter.

And yet...

I looked at Trenati now, truly looking.

His tone was light, his posture relaxed, but there was something there. Something intentional.

But I did not yet have the right shape for it.

So I exhaled softly. No more than a breath. As if this were all just idle chatter. 

“I’m not terribly worried,” I said at last, turning my gaze toward the back of the room. “I’m a fair hand with a sword myself.”  

### * * *

I declined further drinking, aware of how poorly wine and swords mixed, and bid Bredon and Trenati goodnight. Outside the Blind Beggar, the night folded around me, cool and sharp, the kind of air that makes you feel seen. I stood beneath the uneven flicker of a streetlamp, humming *Leave the Town, Tinker* to distract myself from tomorrow—a melody that kept stuttering around the edges of my resolve.  

I was three verses in when Denna’s voice broke gently through my thin defense. “There you are. I thought you'd wandered off with some Vintish strumpet.”  

It was a careless sort of remark, tossed out like a stone skipped across still water. Not meant to land hard. But I knew Denna too well to take anything she said at face value. There was something careful to the way she leaned against a low stone railing, her posture loose, her smile easy.  

I gave her a lopsided grin. “Denna, you know you're the only strumpet for me.”  

For the smallest fraction of a moment, something flickered across her face—not surprise, not humor, something else. A pause. A shift in weight.  

Then, she let out a small, dismissive breath and waved her hand as if brushing away an errant thought. “Well, of course I am.”  

And just like that, it was decided.  

Whatever she might have thought or assumed about me and Devi, whatever curiosity or hesitation had lingered there, she smoothed over in an instant. The matter was settled. Not by any great revelation, not by any heartfelt discussion—just by sheer force of will.  

Denna rarely let herself dwell on things she didn’t want to hurt her. She decided, and it became true.  

She held out her arm, a gesture so effortless it might as well have been instinct. I took it without hesitation.  

Renere stretched before us like a second chance, its streets alive with pockets of firelight and wandering shadows. First, she led me to a tucked-away playhouse, where we caught a bawdy rendition of *The Ghost and the Goosegirl*—a performance saved only by Denna’s laughter, which came soft and helpless, her scarf barely containing it. Later, a chestnut vendor’s crackling brazier offered warmth, and we dirtied our fingers on blackened shells, peeling as we wandered.  

We paid a trio of street musicians for song after song, and though they stumbled over every second note, Denna clapped in time, urging on their uneven enthusiasm. But those were amusements—small lanterns along a path that led to her true surprise. She brought me to a square dominated by a fountain tall enough to hold the moon, its waters leaping in cascades of silver.  

Lanterns floated in the air above us, their flames like amber fireflies tracing slow, uncertain paths against the night. She handed me one, the fragile paper whispering under my fingertips. Together, we lit its wick and let it rise uneasily into the dark, tugged upward until it became a point of light indistinguishable from the stars.  

“I heard about Fascino’s,” she said, her voice light but her eyes fixed on mine. “You can’t brush this off with a clever smile, Kvothe—I’ve seen your scars. I know better.”  

Her words, sharper than I expected, left me fumbling for ease. “I’ll manage,” I told her, but my voice carried the weight of someone promising too much. She looked at me then with that strange intensity she wasn’t always able to hide, as though measuring my promise and everything it might cost.  

“On your good right hand this time?” she asked, a flicker of a smile breaking the silence between us.  

I reached for her hands, clasping them. “On my good right hand,” I said, the promise resting unevenly in the air. As she left me in the square—a shadow folding into starlight—I felt the absence of her warmth more than I cared to admit.  

Alone on the walk back, I stopped in an alley and began stepping through the Ketan, hoping muscle memory might calm the nervous stir within me. My movements were stiff, stuttering like a poorly tuned lute, and I faltered on *Catching Rain,* landing gracelessly on the cold cobblestones.  

Instead of a third attempt, I breathed deeply, willed the tension out of my body, and continued home. By the time I reached the Blind Beggar, I’d made a promise to myself: if I lived through tomorrow, I would not waste another moment.
