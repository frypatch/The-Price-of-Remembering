# CHAPTER 44

## The Hollow Crown  

For the next two days, I was not a man. I was a hollow shell, emptied of everything but the dark tide of my grief. The Tahl brought food I couldn’t eat, water I drank out of reflex. My moments of lucidity were few, and I dreaded them.  

When I closed my eyes, my mind filled with dreams that tore at me like claws. I saw Wil’s face, blood streaking his brow, his trembling lips shaping words of accusation I couldn’t hear. I saw Sim, eyes wide and wet, looking more broken-hearted than betrayed. Then there was Denna—not as she was when I held her, but distant and unyielding, turning her back to me again and again, slipping further away no matter how hard I reached for her. She didn’t need words to make me feel the weight of my failure. And Auri—Auri telling me to live. Her last words to me were the only warmth I felt in those dreams. The only thread that tied me back to the waking world.  

On the third day, I came fully to myself. Denna’s body was gone, the pyres cold, and the circle at the camp’s center cleared away. I never learned where the Tahl had taken her. When I asked, they gestured vaguely, signs I barely understood. *Gone,* was all they could say. Whether this meant buried or burned, I would never know, and the not-knowing lodged itself like a thorn in my chest.  

Part of me wanted to scour the camp for answers, to demand a way to say goodbye. But part of me knew that even if I found her grave, I might not rise again after kneeling there. And so, with Denna’s shadow heavy in my heart, I left the Tahl.  

They gave me more kindness than I deserved—provisions, advice on surviving the desert, even directions to a mountain pass through the Stormwal. They sent me on my way with solemn nods, and I suspected they were glad to see me go. I had become the specter of death haunting their peaceful oasis.  

As dusk fell and the first stars lit the sky, I walked west. My body felt lighter as I crossed the sands, though not for the right reasons. I had been hollowed out, burned to emptiness.

***  

Renere was not the city I remembered.  

I arrived at the gates bruised and blistered, my clothes in tatters, my feet bare. The guards didn’t look twice. No one did. There was a wary air about the city, a sullenness that sank deep into the cobblestones. The streets weren’t abandoned—they were quiet in a way that struck me as worse. Merchants whispered to customers, eager to conclude their dealings, and children played in alleys but kept glancing over their shoulders.  

As I moved deeper into the city, I began to notice the signs—big, red-painted letters streaked across the walls. *Feyda*. The dead king’s name was everywhere, bold against the stone. It was written on banks, on shopfronts, over doorways. I caught sight of a masked figure crouched atop another’s shoulders, scrawling *Feyda* across the shutters of a tavern. They disappeared long before the patrol could sweep through.  

The Maer’s men were easy to spot. They walked in pairs, lanterns burning bright, their white and blue livery spotless against Renere’s grime. They stopped anyone wandering too far from their homes, though the futility of their task was clear in the air. These streets belonged to fear now, with neither faith in the Maer nor full submission to the cultists.  

I made my way through the fractured city, avoiding both guards and trouble. By the time I reached the Blind Beggar, the moon was high, its pale light revealing the cracked shutters of the old inn.

With practiced ease, I tripped the latch on the window and climbed in. The room was unchanged: dusty and bare, as though waiting for us to return. But there was no message, no trace of Bast. As I climbed back out, my stomach knotted with disappointment. I landed lightly in the alley, my heels hitting the stone.  

“You’re losing your touch, Reshi,” came a voice from the shadows.  

My body tensed immediately, my ruined hand rising instinctively to guard myself. A pair of bright eyes emerged from the darkness.  

“Bast,” I breathed, the tension draining out of me.  

“I didn’t mean to scare you,” he said, though his grin was wolfish. He held up a familiar dowsing compass, its needle trembling against the glass. “This thing started moving as soon as you entered the city.”  

“Wil’s compass,” I said, my voice sharp with memory.  

Bast nodded. “I kept it after…” His smile faded. “After everything went wrong.”  

My gut twisted, and I turned the conversation quickly.

"What is happening here now? Renere looks closer than ever to a civil war."

“Well, after the death of the King, and Regent what's his face?” 

“Fascino,” I suggested. 

“That's the one. The Maer, the one you mentioned going to see in Severen, gathered half of Renere at the gates of the Citadel for an address.” Bast looked away sheepishly. 

“Go on,” I prodded. 

“He announced that the entire royal line had been slain, murdered in cold blood, by you.” 

I let out a mirthless laugh. “He did, did he? Figures.” I said despondently. “Awfully convenient though, me just strolling along, taking out everyone who stood between him and Succession.” 

“He had an excuse ready for that. There were rumors already circulating that you were a former associate of his. Rather than deny it, he admitted as much but then claimed he had no idea what you’d intended to do. When he then denounced you, most of the clods believed it, but for those that didn’t Alveron went a step further.” 

“Let me guess, ten gold marks on my head?” 

Bast laughed, “Try, fifty and a Duchy, with a further twenty-five from the Jakis family” 

“I had nothing to do with what happened to the Baron.” I said, genuinely aggrieved. 

“Not according to the Maer, or should I say the King.” 

“So he went through with it then.” I said, unsurprised. 

“Oh yes, royal coronation, the full works.” 

Without thinking, I went to sign ‘emphatic disgust.’ with my damaged hand only to realize it was no longer equipped to do so. 

It was then that Bast noticed the bandage and the missing fingers. “Reshi,” he gasped. “Your hand!” 

I held it up, taking it in, “It’s every bit as bad as it looks.” 

“Maybe I can do something to help.” 

Curious as I was, unaware what medical knowledge the Fae had of such things, I brushed it aside. “Not right now. You were telling me about the Maer.” 

“Right. After he set the bounty on your head, Alveron trotted out a bunch of priests, then made a big show of kneeling before them, proclaiming his repentance for not stopping you, that he’d accepted the iron chains and a life in service to Tehlu in penitence. Rambling on about how he ‘holds justice foremost in his heart’ and blah blah, you know the type of rubbish your religious folk spout.” Bast let out a nervous laugh, “After he was crowned, his first decree was that you, and any of your cohorts, would be brought to justice in the same way Wil and Sim had.” 

At their mention, I looked away. My teeth clenched. I thought of their families reacting to such news, learning that their sons had been branded accomplices to regicide. That Alveron would use them in such a way made my blood boil. 

“That was when I had the idea,” Bast continued, “I was able to get a job carting out the bodies after the coup. That's where I found Wilem and his compass. Honestly, it's been so long since it happened, I was considering throwing it in the river, but when you got nearer, it just started moving again, I almost jumped out of my skin.” 

“Were you able to see to them?” I asked ashamed. 

“I did. At least I think I did. I'm not familiar with your manling burial customs, just another thing you'll need to teach me.” he said, offering me a somber smile. “They're buried next to each other, in a plot just south of here.” 

I clapped my good hand against his shoulder. “Well, for what it’s worth, I'm glad you found me, Bast.” 

“That wasn’t all I learned, Reshi,” he said, flashing me a knowing grin. “Auri is alive.”
