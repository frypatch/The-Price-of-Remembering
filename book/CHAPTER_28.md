# CHAPTER 28.

## FOR THE GREATER GOOD.


LEVENTIS WASN’T MUCH to look at, a gathering of crooked rooftops and muddy streets where the Four Corners tangled in trade. Nothing about it demanded notice. Yet places like these often held secrets far greater than themselves.  

Denna fell into step beside me as we neared the center of town, her dappled mare trailing lazily behind. The breeze played gently with the ribbon in her hair, the bright red band a rare splash of color against the dull, dusty street.  

“So, what’s the plan?” she asked, her voice both playful and curious. “I imagine we haven’t come all this way just for a quiet pint and an early night.”  

I hesitated before answering, knowing what I had to say and dreading the reaction it would bring. “I need to go in alone.”  

Denna raised an eyebrow at me, the one she used whenever my reasoning amused her. “Forgive me. I wasn’t aware this had suddenly become your quest in your private corner of the world.”  

“It’s not like that,” I said quietly, carefully. “There are things I haven’t told you yet. Things I should have told you before now.”  

Her expression shifted, amusement falling away and replaced by something sharper and colder. “Things,” she repeated slowly, the word heavy enough to anchor me in place.  

“Yes.” I forced myself to continue walking, though each step felt more awkward than the last. “If what I seek is really inside that tavern,” I trailed off, searching for the right way to say it, but everything just sounded like a coward's evasion. “It could put you in danger.”  

She reached out, catching my arm and stopping me in the middle of the path. Her eyes locked mine. “Kvothe, I’m a big girl. I’ve taken care of myself far longer than you’ve known me. I’m no stranger to risk.”  

“I know,” I answered quickly. Too quickly. “But if things go badly inside, these people have no love for strangers. Especially strangers asking dangerous questions. If I go alone, I won’t hesitate. I won’t be distracted.”  

“I know,” I said quickly. Too quickly. “I know that. But if something goes wrong in there…” I gestured vaguely to the squat, sagging tavern at the edge of the square. “These people don’t take kindly to outsiders, especially ones who ask questions. If it’s just me, I won’t hesitate. I can handle it.”  

Her grip loosened slightly, though her fingers still lingered gently on my sleeve. “You really are terrible at lying, Kvothe.”  

I offered her the best smile I could manage under the circumstances. “Then it’s fortunate I’m not lying.”  

She released me then, crossing her arms in front of her chest. “Fine. But I won’t wait forever, and I won’t fish you out of a ditch if you stir up trouble.” Then, as if desperate to not part on a bitter note, she added, “Don’t linger too long.”  

I nodded and turned toward the squat, sagging tavern at the edge of the square.  

### * * *

The Weeping Eye was nearly empty. Even so, there was nothing welcoming in its solitude. Dust drifted slowly through a single shaft of sunlight from the twisted window, the air heavy with an unpleasant must. A handful of patrons sat quietly in shadowed corners. Their murmuring voices died away as I pushed the door shut behind me.  

The barkeep glanced toward me without much interest, the weary gaze of a man disturbed by an unwelcome arrival. I walked up to the counter, noticing the way the neglected floorboards sagged under a weight that hadn’t changed in years.  

“Finger tea,” I said softly.  

The bartender grunted, reached for a cup, and began pouring with all the care he might lend to washing his hands.  

Silence stretched out around me. I felt the eyes of every man in the room settle on my back. Their gazes pressed into my skin, urging me to turn and face them. Instead, I slid the cup aside when it was placed before me and leaned closer toward the barkeep.  

“I’m looking for Claude,” I murmured.  

His hand froze mid-motion, but his expression didn’t change. Without a word, he glanced over my shoulder.  

Footsteps scraped behind me, followed by the heavy sound of wood dropped into place. Someone had barred the door, and the tavern grew colder by the moment. My fingers brushed Caesura at my side, the leather of the scabbard rough beneath my hand.  

Before I could decide what came next, a voice, calm and unfamiliar, broke the silence.  

“I’d leave that sword be if I were you.”  

The speaker sat alone at a nearby table. His hair was white and thin, his scalp showing through like glimpses of pale parchment. His face was weathered like seasoned oak, worn but unyielding. Despite his age, the room seemed smaller for his presence, filled by a quiet authority that brooked no argument. A slim dagger of Ramston steel rested in a plain sheath at his hip.  

“You wanted Claude,” he said, holding my gaze firmly. “You’ve found him. Sit.”  

I paused, scanning the dim room. Men stood watchfully at the edges, their hands resting quietly on clubs and knives. They did not move. This was no gathering of common brawlers. It felt sharper, colder.  

Slowly, deliberately, I crossed the distance to his table and eased myself into the chair opposite.  

Claude’s eyes pinned me like bits of sharp blue ice. “Who sent you?”  

“Dagon.”  

Claude did not blink, nor did he seem surprised. “Dagon,” he repeated slowly. “If that’s true, he gave you no token or sign known to us. Which leaves me wondering why he’d send a boy here without a proper mark.”  

“I told him I had questions,” I said carefully. “He told me you might have answers.”  

Claude let out a dry, brittle laugh. “The Amyr rarely speak to outsiders.” He leaned back, fingers drumming lightly on the tabletop. “But I’ll humor you. Ask your question, boy.”  

I spoke plainly, unwilling to waste the moment. “How do I find the Chandrian?”  

The air grew instantly tighter, sharper, dangerous enough to cut.  

Claude’s expression turned cold. “You will not speak their names here,” he warned, quiet and firm. “Do it again and you won’t finish the word.”  

I nodded slowly.  

“Why do you seek them?” he asked. His voice was gentle, but his words carried the weight of stone.  

“To kill them,” I replied simply.  

He studied me closely, his expression unreadable. “Others have tried. No one has succeeded. Not truly. What makes you any different?”  

I swallowed, my voice firm despite the weight of his scrutiny. “I have the will to see it through. No matter the cost.”  

Claude’s lips twisted downward into something harder than a frown. Something older. “Then, if you know their names you don’t need me or mine. Names are a summons. Speak them in the wrong shadow, boy, and they’ll find you before you can so much as draw that pretty sword.”  

I let out a slow breath. His words carried an awful kind of truth, jagged-edged and cold.  

“You mentioned others have tried,” I said, pressing on. “What happened?”  

“They killed the Chandrian,” Claude said quietly. “But death never holds them long. They returned. Fire and ruin. Vengeance and bloodshed. The stories always end the same way. You cannot kill the wind. You cannot drown the sea.”  

I leaned forward, determined to press further. “Then what is your role in all this? What do you Amyr do, hiding here in shadow?”  

Claude’s face remained calm. “We thwart them. We silence their stories. We erase their names from memory.”  

“For the greater good,” I said quietly.  

“For the greater good,” he echoed, and for the first time his weariness was visible. “But if you expect us at your back with blades drawn, you’re mistaken. We are fewer now, scattered and hunted.”  

My temper stirred within me, but I held it in check. Even if they could not be moved to fight the seven, maybe they could still help Auri. “A coup is stirring,” I pressed. “Renere will fall if no one intervenes.”  

Claude regarded me silently for a long moment. “We don’t meddle in affairs of state unless the Seven are involved. Even at our height, we did not fight for kings or their crowns.”  

“Even if kingdoms collapse into chaos?” I asked sharply.  

“Even then,” he replied, his voice steady.  

The anger in me cooled quickly, replaced by bitterness. I rose from my seat, ready to leave, but Claude’s voice stopped me once more.  

“A word of advice, boy.” His tone was softer now, tempered by a strange kindness. “The weight of the world will break you if you think to carry it alone.”  

### * * *

Denna was waiting just where I left her. “Stoic, angry, and frustrated,” she teased as I approached. “I’d recognize that expression anywhere. Didn’t go well, did it?”  

“No,” I admitted.  

Instead of pressing me further, she fell into step at my side, her silence a rare but comforting presence.  

If the Amyr wouldn’t act, I would.
