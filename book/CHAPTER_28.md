# CHAPTER 28

## FOR THE GREATER GOOD

LEVENTIS WASN’T MUCH to look at, a gathering of crooked rooftops and muddy streets where the Four Corners tangled in trade. Nothing about it demanded notice. Yet such unremarkable places often held remarkable secrets.  

Denna fell into step beside me as we approached the center of town, her dappled mare trailing lazily behind her. The breeze toyed with the ribbon in her hair, its bright red band a rare bit of color against the town’s dreary dust.  

“So, what’s the plan?” she asked, her tone light but curious. “I’m guessing you’re not here for a quiet pint and an early bed.”  

I hesitated before answering, knowing what I had to say and dreading the fallout regardless. “I need to go in alone.”  

Denna raised an eyebrow—the one she always used when she found me particularly amusing. “I’m sorry, did I not get the memo about this being your quest and your town?”  

“It’s not that,” I said, careful to keep my tone gentle. “This isn’t about trust. There are… certain things I haven’t told you.”  

Her face softened, amusement exchanged for something far sharper. “Certain things,” she repeated, with just enough weight to pin me in place.  

“Yes.” I forced myself to keep walking, each step feeling more unnatural than the last. “If what I hope is inside *is* there, it might…” I trailed off, searching for the right way to say it—or at least something that wouldn’t sound like a coward's evasion. “It might be dangerous for you.”  

She reached out, catching my arm and stopping me in the middle of the path. Her eyes locked mine. “Kvothe, I’m a big girl. I’ve taken care of myself far longer than you’ve known me.”  

“I know,” I said quickly. Too quickly. “I know that. But if something goes wrong in there…” I gestured vaguely to the squat, sagging tavern at the edge of the square. “These people don’t take kindly to outsiders, especially ones who ask questions. If it’s just me, I won’t hesitate. I can handle it.”  

Her grip on my arm loosened, though she didn’t let go entirely. “You’re terrible at lying, you know.”  

I gave her the wryest smile I could muster. “Good thing I’m not lying.”  

She let me go, crossing her arms. “Fine. But I’m not waiting all day, and I’m not pulling your body out of a ditch if this blows up in your face. Don’t take too long, Kvothe.”  

I nodded and turned toward the tavern. Her shadow stayed burned into my mind as I went, each step feeling heavier the closer I got.  

### * * *

The Weeping Eye was almost empty, though it felt far from welcoming. Dust danced in the single shaft of light from the warped window, the air thick with damp and disuse. A few patrons lingered in the dimness, their murmured conversations fading as I pushed the door closed behind me.  

The bartender glanced at me without interest, like someone mildly annoyed by the arrival of a late delivery. I walked up to the counter, watching the way the floorboards sagged under weight that hadn’t changed in years.  

“Finger tea,” I said.

The bartender grunted, reached for a cup, and began pouring with all the care he might lend to washing his hands.  

The silence stretched long enough for me to feel the eyes on my back. Every man in the room had stopped talking. My skin prickled with the awareness of their gaze, though I refused to turn. Instead, I pushed the mug away as it was set down and leaned closer to the barkeep.  

“I’m looking for Claude,” I said softly.  

The mug stopped halfway across the bar. The bartender’s hand froze, but his expression didn’t change. Without a word, he glanced over my shoulder.  

I caught the sound of footsteps, the faint scrape of a chair leg. Someone walked to the door and dropped something heavy—a wooden bar sliding into place with a deliberate thud.  

The room was suddenly colder. My fingertips brushed Caesura at my side, the leather scabbard rough beneath my palm. Before I could decide the next move, an unfamiliar voice broke the quiet.  

“I’d leave that sword be if I were you.”

The man who spoke sat alone. His hair was white, thin enough to let hints of pale scalp shine through, and his weathered face seemed carved from an old oak. Despite his age, his presence was cutting—a quiet, deliberate authority that made the room feel smaller. A slim dagger of Ramston steel rested in a plain sheath at his side.

“You wanted Claude,” he continued. “Here I am. Sit.”

I hesitated, my eyes brushing the room. Men lingered at the edges, their hands resting on cudgels and knives but not moving. It wasn’t a room of drunks or brawlers. It was something colder. Sharper.

Slowly, I approached the table and lowered myself into the seat opposite him.

“So,” he said, his blue eyes fixed on me like chips of frost. “Who sent you?”

“Dagon.”

Claude didn’t flinch. Didn’t so much as raise a brow. “Dagon,” he drawled. “If that’s true, he gave you no proper sign. No name we’d know. That leaves me curious—why would he send a boy like you here unmarked?”

“I told him I had questions,” I said evenly. “He said you had answers.”

A faint chuckle escaped Claude, dry as dead leaves. “The Amyr aren’t in the habit of answering to outsiders.” He leaned back in his chair, fingers tapping lightly on the tabletop. “But tell me, what’s your question, boy?” 

I didn’t hesitate. The moment was too precious—and too precarious. “How do I find the Chandrian?”  

The air didn’t just grow still. It turned sharp. Dangerous. The kind of silence that could cut.  

Claude’s expression cooled instantly. “You will not speak their names here,” he said, his voice low and deliberate. “Do so, and you’ll be dead before the word leaves your lips.”  

I nodded. “Why do you seek them?” he asked, and though the question was soft, it carried the weight of stone.  

“To kill them,” I said plainly.  

He leaned back slightly, his expression unreadable. “Many have tried. None have succeeded, not truly. What makes you think you’ll be different?”  

I swallowed, my voice firm despite the weight of his scrutiny. “The will to see it through. No matter the cost.”  

His lips twisted into something like a frown, but heavier, carved from something older. “Then you know their names,” he said. “And if that’s true, you don’t need me or mine. Names are a summons. Speak them in the wrong shadow, boy, and they’ll find *you* before you can so much as draw that pretty sword.”  

I let out a slow breath. His words carried an awful kind of truth, jagged-edged and cold.  

“You mentioned others have tried,” I said, pressing on. “What happened?”  

“They killed them,” Claude said simply. “And still they returned. Fire and ruin, vengeance and retribution. Again and again, the stories end the same. You cannot kill the wind, boy. You cannot drown the sea.”  

His words simmered in my mind. I leaned forward slightly. “And the Amyr? What is your role in all of this? What do *you* do, sitting in shadow?”  

Claude didn’t blink. “We thwart their plans where we can. We bury their names and silence their stories. We make the world forget.”  

“For the greater good.”  

“For the greater good,” he echoed hollowly, and his weariness showed for the first time. “But if you think we will stand at your back with swords drawn, you are mistaken. We are not what we once were, boy. We are fewer now, scattered and hunted. And even then, we do not fight wars for kings or men.”  

I felt my temper flare, but I kept it leashed. I straightened slightly. “What about Renere? There is a coup coming. I’ve seen the pieces moving. Without intervention, the capital will fall.”  

Claude studied me for a long moment. “The Amyr do not meddle in the affairs of state unless the Seven are tied to them. We will not spill blood for thrones and crowns.”  

“Even when kingdoms slip into chaos?” I shot back.  

“Even then,” he said, unmoving.  

The fire in me dwindled, turning cold with bitterness. I stood, and as I turned to leave, Claude’s voice stopped me.  

“Let me give you advice, boy. The weight of the world will crush you if you think to carry it alone.”

### * * *

Denna was waiting just where I left her. “Stoic, angry, and frustrated,” she teased as I approached. “I’d recognize that expression anywhere. Didn’t go well, did it?”  

“No,” I admitted.  

Instead of pressing me further, she fell into step at my side, her silence a rare but comforting presence.  

If the Amyr wouldn’t act, *I would.*
