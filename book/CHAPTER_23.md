# CHAPTER 23.

## THE THREAD UNRAVELS.


THE COMMON ROOM of the Blind Beggar smelled of stale ale, dying embers, and the kind of silence that follows a knife fight no one talks about.

Sim lounged like a man intending to look at ease. His cup rolled between restless fingers, the dregs of his drink tilting back and forth against the firelight.

Wilem, steady as ever, sat stiff-backed, hands folded too precisely in his lap. His posture looked effortless, but I knew what it meant—his tension lived somewhere behind his ribs, deep enough to be dangerous.

Bast looked the most at ease, though he shouldn't have. He was draped over a chair like a cat sprawled in the sunlight, but his fingers grazed the hilt of his knife—not as a weapon, but as something familiar.

No one spoke of the duel, but the weight of it sat between us, an unsheathed blade laid carefully on the table.

I let the silence settle before setting my own cup down—not loudly, not harshly, just enough to press a ripple into the quiet.

I rubbed at my temple. There was something nagging at me—something about the court, something out of place. It scratched at the edges of my thoughts, like a word on the tip of my tongue. Something sharp, angled, wrong.

And yet, when I reached for it, it was just past my grasp.

I exhaled, willing it away, and said, “I saw Auri."

Her name did not feel right in my mouth. Not here. Not in a place of thick wood and firelight, of rough-stitched quiet and thick ale. It belonged elsewhere, in the hush of old clay pipes beneath the city, in the rhythm of bare feet on tiled rooftops. Here she was Princess Ariel.

Sim straightened. “She—she was there?”

Bast hummed under his breath. Not quite laughter. “Of course.”

The certainty in his voice dug at me. Because, to Bast, it had to be true. In the Fae, stories were not stories. They were truth. And a lost princess appearing precisely when the tale called for her? Exactly what should happen.

“Prince Trenati was with her,” I said.

Bast scoffed. But it wasn’t his usual amused disdain. “Royal boy’s finally taking an interest in his lost sister? How touching.”

Sim caught the hesitation in my voice. "Do you mean with her, or near her?"

There was a difference.

I exhaled slowly. “He wasn’t speaking to her. But I don’t think it was coincidence. He stood just close enough.”

Sim leaned forward, brow furrowed. “Like someone with authority.”

I nodded. “Like a man ensuring people saw him standing there.”

Wilem, ever watchful, tested his words before speaking. "Maybe he’s more jailor than brother."

The words did not land lightly. They sat heavy between us, an unsheathed knife laid on the table, waiting for someone to pick it up.

I exhaled through my nose, willing the ache between my temples into something orderly, something I could press into shape.

The door creaked open. A man in the livery of a noble attendant stepped inside.

All four of us turned.

"Apologies for the intrusion. Lord Vatis has succumbed to his wounds."

The air in the room swallowed the words.

Wil straightened in his seat, forehead creasing. “He was still alive when we left.”

“No,” I said simply. Not angry, not questioning. Just fact.

I saw him.

He was fine.

Bast exhaled sharply, shaking his head as if the whole situation were a joke not designed for laughter.

“Ah, yes. A scratch on the ribs, a bruised leg—clearly fatal wounds, if you’re an idiot.”

He pause. A slow blink. Then, dull certainty pressed into his voice.

“And naturally, this is your fault.”

The man—who had merely been sent to deliver a message, not argue—lowered his head quickly and left.

A long, brittle silence.

Then, Wil murmured, “Either someone was careless with the stitches…”

Sim rubbed his temples. “Or someone wanted him dead.”

Bast drummed his fingers against the table. “Dead men tell worse stories than embarrassed ones.”

None of us laughed. Things had just gone from urgent to dire.

I pressed a hand to my still-bandaged cut, exhaling slow through my nose. There were lines here, I just needed to connect them.

That brief exchange between Trenati and the steward—the one Bredon had made sure that I noticed. Why?

I reached deeper, searching the half-light of recall.

There had been a ring on Trenati’s hand.

Not Roderick’s crest.

One of those smaller details I had cataloged without thinking—shoved into memory’s quiet attic, useful for later.

It hadn’t seemed relevant then. Why would it have been?

Had it been worn down? Reforged? No, something else.

The flame-light flickered against the carvings.

Locked geometry, shifting lines carved into gold. Something about the pattern pulled at me, a hook caught between memory and certainty.

I had seen something like this before, I was sure of it.

Ciphers. That was it. Kilvin had once shown me geometric ciphers used by artificers to disguise alchemical recipes, patterns woven to blur their true purpose—to hide meaning in plain sight.

My first instinct had been to catalog the ring as something similar—an idle flourish of a jeweler. But when I told Sim, his fingers went still around his cup. The firelight caught something wrong in his expression, pulling all the rosiness from his cheeks.

His mouth opened—closed.

No. Not closed. Braced. Like a man about to say something he doesn’t want to hear leave his own lips.

"Tehlu’s wrath." His voice was soft—too soft. The kind of soft that follows a knife sliding out of its sheath. "That’s Feyda’s Mark."

I had not recognized it, forgotten things stay forgotten until someone dares to remember them. But Sim—far, far down in the line of Aturan succession—had learned his history well.

“You’re sure?” Wilem asked carefully.

Sim turned to him, voice steady. “You don’t understand, Wil. No one wears that ring. Not in jest. Not in secrecy." He swallowed. “Two noble houses destroyed their own crests rather than be mistaken for it.”

Bast was still.

Not his usual lazy amusement, nor his sharp-edged mockery—just still. Watching.

It was only then I noticed his fingers had stopped moving against his knife-hilt. 

“Human rulers are stupid things,” he murmured. “But they’re never stupid enough to carve a forgotten name into gold unless they mean it.”

I agreed, though my mind still leapt back toward the ring, toward the pattern. And suddenly, I saw the lines for what they were.

Someone had altered it. The geometries were rotated, the perspective was shifted, and the framing just different enough to disguise the intent—subtle, clever. A deceit meant for those who only half-remembered, a quiet manipulation designed to turn recognition into a passing thought.

My fingers twitched against the grain of the table. No, that wasn’t possible. Feyda’s Mark was a piece of history, exiled long before my father’s father was ever born. A symbol discarded as ruin. I’d read enough about noble crests to know that much. 

Hadn’t I? 

I frowned, fingers drumming against the table. Except—I never actually had, had I?

I had studied heraldry under nobles, scribes, merchants alike. Pored over succession laws, court intrigues, ruined bloodlines.

But I couldn’t actually recall any full accounting of Feyda’s Mark. 

No descriptions of its exile. No noble family disgraced or cursed for its use. 

A story erased unclean still leaves behind its ink.

But there were no stains from this. Nothing left in the margins of history. As if Feyda’s Mark had been swallowed completely.

Not erased in scandal. Not recorded in disgrace.

Just... gone.

A slow breath left me.

Yes, it had to be.

This knowledge had been buried.

But that made no sense. The University hoarded knowledge, even when its masters sought to leash it. I’d spent years among those silent tomes, and I had never once found a full accounting of Feyda’s Mark. Not its meaning, not its exile, not its absence.

And absence, I was beginning to realize, was its own kind of presence.

My jaw clenched.

"Wil." My voice was too sharp, too pointed, for the delicate question. You worked as one of Master Lorren's scrives, "How many texts in the University speak plainly about Feyda’s Mark?" 

Wilem did not answer immediately. His fingers flexed, just barely, against the wood of the table.

Then, slowly, "I—I don’t know." A pause. "No one mentions it past references in succession disputes." Another pause. "But nothing recent. Maybe there’s some work in the locked stacks—" 

Sim was watching me now. Tensed, listening. "Kvothe. What are you thinking?" 

I exhaled. Thinking of Ambrose Jakis. 

I thought of his endless tenure at the University, dragging through his studies with the leisurely pace of a man who wasn’t actually interested in study. I had always assumed he lingered because of decadence, laziness, spite. Because he was too important to be made to leave. 

But that wasn’t right, was it?

No. That was absurd. Ambrose is arrogant, petty, cruel. He wastes effort on insults, on petty vengeance. He isn’t clever. He isn’t patient.

And yet.

Baresh had muttered to me, years ago, that it wasn’t natural for a noble heir to linger at the University so long. Most sons of titled families spent two, three years at most.

But Ambrose? Six. Longer.

He had no hunger for study. So why had Ambrose stayed?

Had he wasted time? Perhaps. Or had he been buying time?

No, I had to be wrong. Had to be—

And yet.

The books I never found. The locked stacks. The documents that disappeared before I could reach them.

I had always assumed Ambrose destroyed things because it was inconvenient for me.

But what if it had never been about me at all?  

The silence stretched taut, sharp with unspoken conclusions.

Finally, I let the words slip, quiet and knife-edged, "What if Ambrose wasn’t just in the University for himself?"

Ambrose Jakis had been erasing things that didn’t belong to him.

Books. Stories. Names lost in burned ink.

And now, he was doing the same with Auri—rewriting her into Ariel, erasing everything she truly was.

My fingers tightened into a fist on the tabletop before I realized I was clenching them. She hates being looked at. Hates it so much that even when I called her "Auri" for the first time, she had flinched. Not at the sound, but at the weight of it—having her name acknowledged was as intimate as a knife pressed against her skin.

I had learned what kind of silence to leave for her. When to look away so she could exist as herself, unobserved. I had learned when not to see her—when the length of a shadow, the hush of moving air, had to be enough proof of her presence.

I remembered once, when I had found her sitting on her rooftop, her face turned toward the wide-open sky with its cartwheel of stars. She hadn’t seen me yet, hadn’t stiffened or folded inward. She was entirely herself. The moment I stepped into the clearing, she had curled away, tucking herself into a place small enough where she thought no one could follow.

And now she is being dressed for court. Displayed before noble eyes. Smoothed, styled—wearing the name they’ve chosen for her instead.

I felt the bile rise under my tongue. 

I had promised her she would always be safe under my protection. Auri trusted me. 

I tried drinking after that. Three sips told me it wasn’t going to help.

Instead, I leaned forward, studying Wilem and Sim across the table. "We need leverage on Trenati."

"That is not what we need," Wilem countered.

His voice was measured—but not calm. Not truly. His hands stayed too neatly in his lap, his shoulders too controlled. The way a man settles himself before the first blow lands.

Then, lower:

"You don’t understand what you’re reaching for."

The fire crackled. A chair creaked somewhere in the room.

"This isn’t a game where you upturn the board with a clever move. I know these types. I’ve seen the way their families shape cities, silence rivals. You don’t fight men like this."

His jaw clenched. "You survive them. If you’re careful. If you're lucky."

He exhaled sharply, suddenly shaking his head—like a man trying not to say something. Then:

"Damn you, Kvothe."

His voice was low, not angered, not pleading. Just simple, weary truth.

"You don’t run from fire. You always run toward it."

He wasn’t wrong.

But it didn’t matter. There was no right way to do this, no safe way to tear a locked door off its hinges. I wasn’t looking for equal footing—I was looking for a weak point. I was looking for the place where their rules could be broken.

And I was willing to bet that if we found the right type of evidence, we could convince Trenati to hand over Auri.

### * * *

Auri's time was running out.

That thought beat under every moment, more insistent than my pulse.

The court had already accepted Ambrose Jakis as her suitor. The wedding date had not yet been set, but it wouldn’t be long. No royal house would wait to finalize a match like this. If we didn’t act soon, Auri would be his—bound and broken in a way I couldn’t undo.

That truth chased me down the streets of Renere, turning every wasted hour into another hour Ambrose spent tightening his grip on her future.

Trenati left no footprints. That was the problem.

Even the most cautious ones left markers—a favored tailor, a particular vintner supplying their table, perhaps a discreet card house where debts were quietly settled in gold and sharp glances. No one as prominent as Prince Trenati could move through a city like Renere without leaving some kind of imprint. Not unless someone was deliberately sweeping his footprints from the dust.

Wilem tried the official channels first.

Four days of court records, audience logs, and public engagements turned up what looked, at first glance, like a perfectly ordinary schedule.

But something was wrong with it.

On the 22nd, the records claimed Trenati had overseen trade negotiations between the glassmakers’ guild and the ambassador from Modeg.

Wilem tracked down a glass merchant who had been present at the trade negotiations.

“Trenati?” the merchant hesitated for just a second, like a man struggling to place a face in a half-remembered dream. Then he scoffed, shaking his head. “Of course, he was there.”

“You sound uncertain,” Wilem pressed.

The merchant exhaled sharply, as if shaking something off. “No, no. I know he was. I just…” He rubbed his forehead, frowning. “It’s odd. Normally, I'd remember something specific he said, a joke, an insult—Trenati's the sort who burns his words into a room. But I... I only remember that he was drinking. Talking. Something about tariffs."

He exhaled again, muttering, "Tehlu’s teeth, maybe I need to drink less at these meetings."

Wil made a note, relief settling low in his ribs. A confirmation. Maybe they were imagining discrepancies after all—

“Wait,” another glassmaker interrupted. “Trenati? No—he wasn’t there.”

Wil turned back. "What do you mean?"

“That wasn’t him. That was Minister Halbrecht. Trust me, I’d remember—between him and the Modigan ambassador, we nearly drowned in wine that day.”

The contradiction sharpened something at the edge of Wilem’s mind. He pressed the second merchant harder. No luck. The details didn’t match, but neither man seemed to second-guess themselves.

One single mistake in the records? That could be negligence.

But then came more.

On the 24th, Trenati was recorded as attending a formal procession—yet the uniforms the guards wore that day did not match the season’s colors for the Citadel’s royal escorts.

The 27th listed him as a guest at the House of Seven Wells—a high aristocratic gathering known for its scrutiny of attendance. But when Wilem found an attendant from the event, she simply frowned at her ledger.

“That can’t be right..." she murmured, brow furrowing deeply at the missing entry. "...That night was full. Every guest accounted for.”

“Then why isn’t Trenati listed?” Wilem asked.

She bit her lip. Fingertips tightened over the edge of the ledger’s worn leather.

“But I swear he was there,” she murmured under her breath, almost to herself. “I saw him. I mean, I think I did…”

Her fingers traced the blank space in the ledger, following where his name should have been. Her frown deepened.

Then, her posture changed. Ever so slightly, her stiffened spine smoothed into something else—something more controlled.

That moment’s uncertainty vanished, smoothed over like a crease in silk. "I can’t help you," she said, voice suddenly even. Too even.

Wilem opened his mouth.

"I can’t help you,” she repeated. And she shut the ledger.

When they left the room, Wilem exhaled. “That was deliberate.”

“You think?" Sim muttered, rubbing his forehead. "She looked like we’d asked her to recall a dream she hadn’t finished having."

Wilem flipped open his own small record-book—the careful orderly notes he’d made over the last few days—thumb trailing along the empty space where Trenati should have been.

His breath hitched.

It wasn’t empty.

A date, written in his own hand, sat clear as day on the page: "Trenati - House of Seven Wells, 27th."

He blinked hard.

I checked this earlier. I checked this four times. It wasn’t there. It wasn’t.

Sim was still talking—something about how the contradictions were piling up—but Wilem stared at his own handwriting, trying to remember writing it.

He couldn't.

He should say something. He should—he—

No. That was ridiculous. He was exhausted. He must have overlooked it, scribbled the note and misfiled it in his head, that’s all.

Tucking the notebook away, he exhaled slowly. “We should keep moving.” 

And so it continued.

His name appeared where presence was expected, but the details frayed at the edges. People recalled seeing him in passing but not speaking to him, not interacting.

It was as if Trenati existed just enough to discourage deeper questions but not enough to truly be observed.

If no one was looking too closely, they would never notice the gaps.

Simmon, meanwhile, took to the markets, the tea-houses, the gossip dens.

Unlike Wilem’s records, which were too polished, Sim expected the lower classes of Renere to provide more natural insights.

He was wrong.

Everywhere he went, Trenati’s presence was strangely fragmented, contradictory.

At the docks, a sailor swore Trenati had overseen an ivory shipment. “Clear as day. Wore that dark blue brocade coat of his, same as always.”

"Same as always?" Sim repeated.

"Sure," the man nodded. “He was wearing it last time he came, too.”

Sim and Wilem exchanged glances.

“And that last time was…?” Wil prompted.

"Dunno.” The sailor frowned. “Feels like no more than a couple weeks back."

But Sim had already checked. Trenati had been supposedly attending trade talks in Modeg the entire season.

At an upper-market tea shop, one serving girl told Sim, “Oh, no, he never visits.”

“He was here.” The second server insisted. “Blue brocade, same as always. Stood over by the window. I remember the light caught his hair—he had that *look.*”

The first server hesitated, lips pressing together.

"You’re thinking of someone else," she said firmly.

“No, I know it was him.”

A pause.

A flicker of hesitation.

“...Don’t I?”

The second server frowned again, brows knitting, like she was grappling with a loose thread in her own mind. Finally, almost defensively: "It was him."

"And I was the one writing down orders, wasn’t I?" The first woman’s voice had an odd edge now.

"Yes, and you nodded at him, I saw you—"

“Then why don’t I remember doing it?”

The second server opened her mouth, then shut it.

A slow, creeping silence stretched between them and Sim felt a small chill run up the back of his neck.

When we were back at the Blind Begger later that night Sim let out a breath, rubbing his arms. “It keeps twisting under itself,” he muttered. “It’s not just that they’re covering up his movements—it’s like they’re rearranging them to make sense. The second you stop looking, it feels natural again.”

He straightened, as if trying to shake off the thought. “It’s like… someone’s telling a story, and every time we turn the page, they’ve rewritten it behind us.”

Wilem tapped his notes against his knee, eyes sharp. "Fabrication?"

"No," I said, brow furrowed. "That would leave mistakes. Slipping details, missing names. But this—this feels like something else."

I turned toward Bast. He had been watching the city beyond us, his face cast in shadow, his expression more detached than usual—not bored but wary.

"You're quiet," I said.

Bast rolled a silver coin between his fingers, watching the lamplight flicker over the ridges. For the first time all night, he had stopped smirking.

"Nothing to say?" I pressed, my voice carrying an edge.

His fingers never stopped moving. The coin glinted as it flipped over his knuckles, quick, restless. "I don’t like cities that learn how to hold their tongue, Reshi," he said finally.

Something in the words sent an unshakable chill down my spine.

Wilem noticed my expression. "What does that mean?"

Bast let the question settle, idly flicking the coin and catching it in his palm. "It means," he said lightly, "that even a place can be taught to forget."

It wasn't an answer. It was worse than an answer. It was the shape of something hidden beneath a sheet.

"You knew this the whole time," Wilem said, not accusing, just assessing.

Bast shook his head. "No. I suspected. And now I don’t want to know."

That made Sim stiffen. "If you don't want to know, should we be worried?"

An easy grin flickered across Bast’s face. "Simmon, I've always assumed you should be worried."

But there was nothing easy in his hands. Nothing easy in his weight against the table.

I turned, staring at the city beyond the lamplight, at the soft movement of Renere’s streets. For the first time, I wondered if we were the ones leaving footprints in the wrong places.

A slow breath left Bast’s lips. He turned away from the street, glancing toward me with something unfamiliar in his eyes. Not amusement. Not mischief. A small, sharp-edged weariness.

"Follow your prince to The Whispering Quarter, Reshi," he murmured. "But don't be surprised if the city forgets you when you're gone."
