# CHAPTER 30

## SWIRLS IN THE WATER  

THE NIGHT STRETCHED on, calm and quiet but for the faint rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of crickets. I sat by the dying embers of our fire, unable to sleep. Denna lay nearby, her head resting on her bundled cloak, the soft rise and fall of her breathing a rare, peaceful rhythm. My cloak had slipped across her shoulder, and I resisted the urge to adjust it for fear of waking her. Instead, I watched her for a long while, caught between thoughts of what could be and what might never come.  

For the first time in weeks, my mind strayed toward something simpler. What might life look like when—and if—this was all over? Ralien in the Caeld, maybe, or distant Iskur by the Commonwealth’s edge. I pictured us going somewhere no one knew my name, somewhere without Chandrian or Amyr. But even that small dream felt fragile, like something held in trembling hands.  

The ground trembled faintly beneath me, breaking the stillness. A distant rumble reached my ears like thunder without a storm. I pressed my ear to the ground. Hoofbeats. Dozens of them. No. More.  

“Denna.” My voice was low but urgent. “Denna, wake up.”  

She groaned softly, turning away. I didn’t have time to be gentle. I shook her shoulder harder. “Denna! Get up! Someone’s coming.”  

Her eyes shot open, confusion turning quickly to alarm as she sat up. “What—?”  

“No time,” I said sharply, already on my feet. “We need to move.”  

We scrambled to pack what little we could, leaving behind anything that would slow us. The horses pawed at the earth nervously, sensing the unease in the air, and within moments, we were riding hard into the night.  

### * * *  

The hoofbeats followed us in relentless rhythm, growing louder with each passing minute. My own mount was sluggish, still cold and stiff from sleep, while Denna’s mare strained against her reins, wild-eyed with fear. Whoever was pursuing us wanted us caught.  

“Do you think it’s just patrols?” Denna called over the pounding of hooves, her voice tight with panic.  

“No,” I answered grimly. “They’re tracking us too well.”  

Each time I angled us away from our course, hoping the uneven terrain would slow them, they adjusted their path. Whoever they were, they knew we were their prey. The first shouts reached us not long after, men’s voices carried on the wind—taunts and jeers that were far too close for comfort. I risked a glance over my shoulder. Pale faces flitted through the trees, the faint flicker of torches highlighting greedy grins and the glint of swords.  

“Faster!” I urged, though I knew it was futile. Our horses were flagging, and the ground had grown uneven and treacherous.  

It was only a matter of time before disaster found us. We burst into a wide-open space where an expanse of still water waited like a black mirror. The lake stretched in every direction under the thin light of the moon. The horses slowed instinctively, their hooves splashing into the icy shallows as they hesitated at the sudden change.  

Denna pulled her reins, her voice trembling. “Kvothe?”  

I didn’t answer immediately, my mind racing. Ahead lay the broad, dark water; behind, the men were closing. We wouldn’t make it to the far shore—it was too far, and we’d be easy targets in water this open.  

The riders emerged along the bank, their silhouettes solidifying into men and horses in grim procession. At least a dozen spread along the edge, and in the middle of their group stood a man in leather armor, a thick black beard wrapped in a dozen braids. A spark caught my eye, and he held a torch aloft that flared to life.  

Tam. The name rose unbidden in my chest, though it carried little weight beyond recognition. I’d known him years ago, during one of my first trips with Roent’s caravan. Back then, he’d been a loud-mouthed mercenary; now, he was something worse.  

“Come out o’ the water,” Tam shouted, his deep voice rolling across the lake’s surface. “I promise to make it quick.” He paused, then grinned. “Cross me, and I’ll make it twice as ugly for your lady.”  

The words tasted like bile. I glanced at Denna, who had drawn a thin steel blade. Her hands shook, her eyes wide with fear. Something broke loose inside me at the sight of her like a dam bursting.  

“I’ll kill him,” I muttered, gripping Caesura’s hilt. “I’ll cut his hands off before I let him touch you.”  

“What do we do, Kvothe?” Denna asked, her voice small.  

I steeled myself. “Listen. When I say, ride for the shore and don’t stop. Head south. Don’t look back.”  

“No, I’m not leaving you—”  

“We don’t have time to argue!” I snapped. “Do what I say, Denna. Go.”  

Tam let loose a laugh and began wading in after us, his men following hesitantly, their torchlight casting rippled shadows across the water. I roared back at them, my voice thick with contempt. “Cowards! You’re too afraid to face me alone!”  

The taunt worked. With a grunt, Tam urged his horse forward, his men reluctantly following. I split my mind, reaching deep into sympathy. Eight threads of thought. Then nine. With a grim effort, I froze them in place, their horses thrashing but unable to move forward. Even so, three slipped past my control, charging after Denna as she raced toward the shore.  

“Damn it,” I whispered under my breath, and the icy lake and cold air seemed to answer.  

And then I *saw* it. The Name of the water, written everywhere around me: etched into the moonlight’s reflection on its surface, curled into the rippling waves against my waist. It was beautiful. It was terrible.  

I spoke its Name.  

A thunderous roar filled the air as the lake answered me. A massive swell surged outward, rising higher than a man and collapsing in fury. It lashed toward the bandits, horses screaming as they tried to retreat. The dark wave swallowed them whole, dragging them down into the water’s cold embrace.  

Shivering, I scrambled back to my horse. “Hold on, Denna,” I murmured as I kicked the beast into motion. The poor animal was exhausted, foaming at the bit as I urged it forward, but it obeyed. Somewhere in the distance, Denna needed me.  

### * * *

The horse labored beneath me, its chest heaving, its hooves pounding against dirt and stone as if the beast could sense my desperation. I spotted them ahead, three figures looming like shadows over someone sprawled on the ground.

Denna’s mare screamed in the distance—a terrible, piercing cry that sent a chill rippling up my spine. My heart surged. I didn’t think. I acted.

I leapt from the saddle before my horse came to a stop, the ground rushing up to meet me. My feet hit hard, but I was already moving, Saicere singing free of its scabbard, the blade flashing in the moonlight.

The first man turned toward me, blade swiping in an arc meant to cut me down before I reached him. He was too slow. My sword struck true, carving through his feeble block and crashing against his shoulder. He stumbled, and I followed—a second strike, fast and brutal, split him from temple to jaw. He crumpled without so much as a sound.

The second came with a growl, a torch raised high in one hand, a chipped sword in the other. I met him in a whirl of motion, spinning low and wide. I kicked out—hard—catching his knee, and he stumbled. My blade came up quick across his wrist, cutting the torch from his grasp. He bellowed and charged, swinging wildly.

Too close. My sword caught beneath the body of the first man, lodged firm, and for a moment I had nothing but my open hand.

Then the world slowed. The word came to me—not thought, not intention—just instinct: raw and sharp.
“Fire.”

The torchbearer erupted, flames licking out from his eyes, his mouth. The torch hadn’t caught him. Something else had. His scream choked, high and terrible, as his face melted like wax, as if the fire came from within. He fell, burning and broken before he hit the ground.

The third man froze. His blade hung limply at his side, and his lips moved in a frantic prayer. “Merciful Tehlu, save me…”

“There is no mercy,” I said, my voice hollow—a sound that didn’t feel like my own.

The words barely left my lips when the air shifted. It rushed toward him, a brutal, invisible force tearing its way through the world. He gasped, clawed at his throat, and staggered backward. I saw his chest collapse inward, his ribs bowing like the stays of a ship under too much pressure. Then the noise came: a sharp, final crack, and he fell where he stood, lifeless.

I rushed past him, already forgetting the bodies. The only thing that mattered now was Denna. She was at the base of a boulder, her back pressed tight against it, her face pale and streaked with dirt. Somewhere nearby, her mare limped, still crying softly.

“Denna!” I called, dropping to my knees before her. I reached for her hand, but she pulled it back as if my touch burned. Her eyes fixed on me, her chest heaving, her lips trembling.

She’d seen it all. All of it.

“Denna,” I tried again, softer this time, reaching out once more. Her shiv slipped from her fingers, clinking against the dirt as she shuddered. Then she broke completely, tears carving new streaks into her already tear-stained cheeks as her body buckled.

I caught her before she hit the ground, pulling her into my arms. “It’s over,” I whispered, holding her tight. “You’re safe now.”  

### * * *

For all we’d endured, our wounds were merciful ones. Denna’s mare had fallen in the dark, taking her down hard. She brushed it off, but the streak of dried blood in her hair told another story. Meanwhile, I carried no visible scars, only the kind that haunted. My hands trembled faintly at my sides, their shaking unbidden, unwanted.

The mare hadn’t been so lucky. Her leg had twisted beneath her like a snapped branch, and there were no kind roads left for her to walk. I ended it swiftly, murmuring soft nonsense as if I could quiet the breaking of her breath. That was the worse part—how it lingered, even after she was gone.

Denna said little, but she watched. She always watched.

To distract myself, I turned to a quieter kind of magic. From the bottle I’d scavenged, I poured a ribbon of water into my hands and reached out with a whisper. The Naming answered, subtle and soft, and the water curled into a ring that spun between my fingers. It joined the others I’d long gathered: wind, stone, amber, wood, bone… all containing their own quiet truth.

As the water pooled away into silence, my eyes caught the dying orange nib of a coal in the dirt near where we’d camped. Something simple, nearly hidden under the film of ash. Almost gone, but not quite. The thief in me stooped before the poet could hesitate. I plucked it up with careful fingers, cradling it, listening for the faint whisper of its name.

Fire is a raucous thing, riotous and wild, but there’s a grace to its last glimmer—when it’s smoke and heat but no longer hunger. It took less effort than I expected; the strand of its name came willingly to me. The coal flared briefly, then reshaped itself into a circle, a thin, flickering band of flame around my fingers.

I grinned at the sight. That’s new.

“That’s a pretty thing you’ve made there,” Denna said, her voice catching me between surprise and shame. Her words carried warmth, but her eyes had a sharper glint. She’d been watching me longer than I realized, quiet as frost on glass.

“Comes in handy,” I said lightly, letting the fire spiral away into nothing. Then, I turned and offered her the water bottle.

She hesitated, her fingers brushing the lip of the bottle but not taking it. The moment stretched too long before she withdrew. “No, thank you,” she said simply, her eyes settling on the horizon instead.

### * * *

When morning came, we started forward again. Denna rode my horse now, sitting small in the saddle, her arms wrapped around herself like armor. I kept to the ground, walking alongside them with reins in hand. The road was slick and pocked, and our pace was slow. Still, I found some solace in the thought that we’d reach Renere by tomorrow, late but in time to stop Auri’s wedding.

For a while, we walked in silence, the only sound the creak of the saddle and the steady squelch of the road beneath my boots.

“How do you think they found us?” she asked finally.

I turned the thought over like a stone between my fingers. “Campfire,” I said, too quickly for it to sound honest. “Most likely, they saw the light and thought we’d be easy pickings. Bandits move fast when desperation bites.”

Her eyes stayed forward, quiet but unconvinced. Neither of us believed it was quite so simple.

I wondered if I should tell her what my gut kept whispering: that the bandits had moved too cleanly, their purpose too sharp. Someone had set them after us. Someone who knew what they wanted. But I swallowed the words. Denna carried enough of her own silences without letting me pile mine into her arms.

“The one with the black beard,” I added after a moment, trying to sound casual. “I’ve seen him before. A caravan guard turned mercenary. My guess is they fell on hard times and traded their coin for sharp steel and heavier crimes.” I said it lightly, but the words rang hollow in my mouth.

The silence returned, heavier than before, lingering like a weight neither of us wanted to name.

The crags slowed us to a crawl, the jagged stone biting at my boots and Denna’s cloak catching in the wind. The sun offered light but no warmth, and my feet ached with each step over the uneven ground. Finally, we reached an old pass high in the hills, the narrow path giving us a view that stretched far into the valley below.

I almost missed it at first—a flicker of movement in the canyon below, something too organized to be natural. I stopped dead, scanning the hollow. Then I saw it: rows of tents laid in neat formation, campfires burning low, and the figure of armed men moving with purpose. A camp.

I crouched low, Denna kneeling beside me. "There has to be at least five hundred down there," I murmured, my stomach sinking as I counted the tents. Soldiers moved in clusters, their steel catching traces of sunlight.

“Do you recognize the uniforms?” she asked softly.

“No,” I said, shaking my head. But something else drew my eye: a pale banner, cresting the wind above a large white pavilion at the camp’s center. I froze. Silver trim. A coiled serpent.

“Jakis,” I said grimly. “That many troops this close to Renere… he has to be working with Fascino.”

I stood abruptly, my voice taut with urgency. “We’ve lost too much time already. We need to get back to Renere.”

Denna nodded, though her eyes stayed fixed on the soldiers below, sharp with thought. The wind stirred, flaring the flag once more, and the serpent seemed to coil tighter.
