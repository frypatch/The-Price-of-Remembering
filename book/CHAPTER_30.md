# CHAPTER 30.

## SWIRLS IN THE WATER.


THE NIGHT STRETCHED ON, calm and quiet save for the faint rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of crickets. I sat by the dying embers of our fire, wide awake and restless. Denna lay nearby with her head resting on her bundled cloak, the gentle rise and fall of her breathing a rare and peaceful rhythm. My cloak had slipped from her shoulder, and I resisted the urge to pull it back into place for fear of waking her. Instead, I watched her for a long while, caught between thoughts of what could be and what might never come.  

For the first time in weeks, my mind strayed toward something simpler. What might life look like when this was all over, if it ever ended at all? Perhaps we would journey to Ralien in the Caeld, or to distant Iskur at the edge of the Commonwealth. I pictured us in a place where no one knew my name, somewhere without Chandrian or Amyr casting shadows over our days. Even that small dream felt fragile, like something delicate cupped in trembling hands.  

The ground trembled faintly beneath me, breaking the stillness. A distant rumble reached my ears, like thunder but from a clear sky. I pressed my ear to the earth. Hoofbeats. Dozens of them. No, more.  

“Denna.” My voice was low but urgent. “Denna, wake up.”  

She groaned softly, turning away. I didn’t have time to be gentle. I shook her shoulder harder. “Denna! Get up! Someone’s coming.”  

Her eyes shot open, and confusion gave way to alarm as she sat up. “What?”  

“No time,” I said sharply as I sprang to my feet. “We need to move.”  

We scrambled to pack what little we could, leaving behind anything that might slow us. The horses were already pawing at the earth, sensing the unease in the air, and within moments, we were in the saddle and riding hard into the night.  

### * * *  

Hoofbeats pounded after us in relentless rhythm, growing louder with every heartbeat. My own mount was sluggish, still stiff with cold from sleep, while Denna’s mare fought the reins, wild-eyed with fear. Whoever chased us meant to see us caught.  

“Do you think it’s just patrols?” Denna called out over the pounding of hooves, her voice tight with panic.  

“No,” I called back, voice grim. “They’re tracking us too well.”  

Each time I angled us off course, hoping the uneven terrain might slow them, they adjusted their path to match. Whoever they were, they hunted us like prey. Moments later, the first shouts reached us, jeers carried on the wind far too close for comfort. I stole a glance over my shoulder. Pale faces flickered through the trees, and torchlight glinted off hungry grins and drawn swords.  

“Faster!” I urged, though I knew it was futile. Our horses were flagging, and the ground had grown uneven and treacherous.  

It was only a matter of time before disaster found us. We burst out of the trees into open air. A vast, still lake lay before us, stretching in every direction like a black mirror beneath the pale moonlight. Our horses slowed on their own, hooves splashing in the icy shallows as they balked at the water’s edge.  

Denna reined in her mare. “Kvothe?” My name trembled on her lips.  

I didn’t answer immediately, but my mind was racing. Ahead of us lay nothing but dark water. Behind us, the men were closing in. The far shore was out of reach, and we would be easy targets out on the open water.  

The riders emerged along the lakeshore, their silhouettes solidifying into men on horseback in a grim procession. At least a dozen of them fanned out along the bank. At their center was a man in leather armor, his thick black beard woven into a dozen braids. A spark flashed, and a torch flared to life in his hand as he lifted it high.  

Tam. The name rose unbidden in my mind, but it brought only a spark of recognition. I had known him years ago, on one of my first journeys with Roent’s caravan. Back then he had been merely a loud-mouthed mercenary. Now he was something far worse.  

“Come out o’ the water,” Tam shouted, his deep voice rolling over the lake like distant thunder. “I promise to make it quick.” He paused, then grinned. “Cross me, and I’ll make it twice as ugly for your lady.”  

His words tasted like bile. I glanced at Denna and saw that she had drawn a thin steel blade. Her hands trembled, and her eyes were wide with fear. Something tore loose at the sight of her, as if a dam inside me had burst.  

“What do we do, Kvothe?” Denna asked in a small, frightened voice.  

I steeled myself and met her eyes. “Listen to me,” I said, my voice low and urgent. “When I say go, ride for the shore and don’t stop. Head south. Don’t look back.”  

Denna shook her head. “No, I’m not leaving you,” she protested.  

“We don’t have time to argue!” I snapped. “Do what I say, Denna. Go.”  

Tam let out a harsh laugh and spurred his horse into the shallows after us. His men followed, hesitant, their torchlight casting rippling shadows across the water. I spun and roared at them, my voice thick with contempt. “Cowards! You’re too afraid to face me alone!”  

The taunt worked. Tam grunted and kicked his horse forward. His men followed reluctantly.  

I split my mind, reaching deep into sympathy. Eight threads of thought. Then nine. With a grim effort, I froze most of them in place. Their horses reared and thrashed, but could not move. Still, three riders slipped free of my control and charged after Denna as she raced toward the shore.  

“Damn it,” I whispered under my breath, and the icy lake and cold air seemed to listen. The Name of the water was written everywhere around me. It was etched into the moonlight’s reflection on the surface of the lake and curled within the ripples that lapped at the shore. It was beautiful. It was terrible.  

I spoke its Name.  

A thunderous roar filled the night as the lake answered. A massive swell surged outward, rising taller than a man before crashing down in fury. It lashed toward the bandits, their horses screaming as they tried to flee. The dark wave swallowed them whole, dragging them down into the water’s cold embrace.  

Shivering, I scrambled back into the saddle. “Hold on, Denna,” I murmured as I kicked the beast into motion. The poor animal was exhausted, foaming at the bit as I urged it forward, but it obeyed. Somewhere in the distance, Denna needed me.  

### * * *  

My horse labored beneath me, chest heaving and hooves pounding against the hard earth. It ran as if it could taste the desperation in the air. Ahead, three figures stood in the pale moonlight, looming like long shadows over a small shape sprawled on the ground.  

In the distance, I heard Denna’s mare scream. It was a terrible, piercing sound that sent an icy bolt up my spine.  

My heart surged. I do not even remember leaping from the saddle. One moment I was astride my horse, and the next I hit the ground hard, my knees nearly buckling. But I was already moving. My hand found Saicere’s hilt and the sword slid free of its scabbard with a ringing whisper. The blade caught the moonlight as I sprang forward.  

The first man turned to face me, swinging his sword in a desperate arc meant to cut me down. He was too slow. My strike shattered his feeble guard and bit into his shoulder. He stumbled. I followed with a second stroke, swift and brutal, splitting him from temple to jaw. He crumpled silently to the ground.  

The second rushed at me with a furious growl, a torch blazing in one hand and a notched sword in the other. I met him in a whirl of motion, spinning low and sweeping my leg out under him. My boot connected hard with his knee, and he let out a grunt as he stumbled. I brought my sword up in a sharp arc and slashed across his wrist, knocking the torch from his grasp. He bellowed in pain and lunged, swinging wildly.  

But he was too close. My sword snagged beneath the corpse of the first man and tore from my grip. For a single breath, my hand held nothing but empty air.  

Time seemed to slow. A word rose inside me, unbidden and urgent. It was not born of thought or intention, but of pure instinct. It was raw and sharp on my tongue. I gave it voice before I even realized.  

"Fire."  

The torchbearer burst into flames. Tongues of fire leapt from his gaping eyes and open mouth. The torch itself had not touched him. This fire bloomed from within. He let out a high, choked scream as his face began to melt like wax. He collapsed into a blazing heap before he even struck the ground.  

The third man froze. His sword hung limp at his side and his lips moved in a frantic prayer. “Merciful Tehlu, save me,” he whimpered.  

“I am not Tehlu,” I said. My voice sounded hollow and strange, as if it belonged to someone else.  

The words had barely left my lips when the night itself seemed to roar. A mass of air expunged from him, unseen but brutal. He gasped and staggered back, clawing at his throat. I watched his chest collapse inward, ribs bending like the staves of a barrel under immense pressure. A heartbeat later, a final crack split the darkness. The third man fell where he stood, lifeless.  

I ran past him without a second glance. Denna was all that mattered now. I found her huddled at the base of a tall boulder, her back pressed hard against the stone. Her face was deathly pale and streaked with dirt. Somewhere her lamed mare whinnied softly in fear and pain.  

"Denna!" I called, dropping to my knees beside her. I reached out, but she flinched away as if my touch would burn her. Her eyes were fixed on me, wide and full of terror. Her chest heaved with each ragged breath, and her lips trembled.  

In that instant, I realized she had seen everything. Every terrible moment.  

I tried again, keeping my voice gentle. "Denna," I whispered, reaching toward her once more. Her small knife slipped from her fingers and fell to the dirt with a soft clink. She shuddered, then she broke completely. Fresh tears carved new streaks down her already tear-stained cheeks as her body buckled with sobs.  

I caught her before she hit the ground, pulling her into my arms. “It’s over,” I whispered, holding her tight against me. "You’re safe now."  

### * * *  

For all we’d endured, our wounds were merciful ones. Denna’s mare had fallen in the dark, taking her down hard. She brushed it off, but the streak of dried blood in her hair told another story. Meanwhile, I carried no visible scars, only the kind that haunted. My hands trembled faintly at my sides, their shaking unbidden, unwanted.  

The mare hadn’t been so lucky. Her leg had twisted beneath her like a snapped branch, and there were no kind roads left for her to walk. I ended it swiftly, murmuring soft nonsense as if I could quiet the breaking of her breath. That was the worst part, the way it lingered even after she was gone.  

Denna said little, and moved to keep a cautious distance between us.  

I didn't blame her, I needed to keep distance from myself too. So, to distract myself, I turned to a quieter kind of magic. From the bottle I’d scavenged, I poured a ribbon of water into my hands and reached out with a whisper. The Water answered, subtle and soft, then curled into a ring that spun between my fingers. It joined the others I’d gathered over time, rings of wind, stone, amber, wood, and bone. Each one held its own quiet truth.  

As the water pooled away into silence, my eyes caught the dying orange nib of a coal in the dirt near where we’d camped. Something simple, nearly hidden under the film of ash. Almost gone, but not quite. The thief in me stooped before the bard could hesitate. I plucked it up with careful fingers, cradling it, listening for the faint whisper of its name.  

Fire is a raucous thing, riotous and wild, but there’s a grace to its last glimmer when it’s smoke and heat, its hunger gone. It took less effort than I expected, and the strand of its name came willingly to me. The coal flared briefly, then reshaped itself into a circle, a thin, flickering band of flame around my fingers.  

“That’s a pretty thing you’ve made there,” Denna said, her voice catching me between surprise and shame. Her words carried warmth, but her eyes had a sharper glint. She’d been watching me longer than I realized, quiet as frost on glass.  

“Comes in handy,” I said lightly, letting the fire spiral away into nothing. Then I turned and offered her the water bottle.  

She hesitated, her fingers brushing the lip of the bottle but not taking it. The moment stretched too long before she withdrew. “No, thank you,” she said simply, her eyes settling on the horizon instead.  

### * * *  

At dawn, we set out once more. Denna rode my horse, looking small in the saddle with her arms wrapped around herself like armor, while I walked alongside, leading the horse by the reins. The road was slick with mud and pocked with ruts, which slowed our pace. Still, I found some solace in the thought that we would reach Renere by tomorrow. Maybe at a later hour, but in time to stop Auri’s wedding.  

For a while, we walked in silence. The only sounds were the creak of the saddle and the wet squelch of mud beneath my boots.  

“How do you think they found us?” Denna asked at last.  

I turned the thought over like a stone between my fingers. “Campfire,” I answered, too quickly for it to sound honest. “Most likely they saw our fire and thought we’d be easy pickings. Bandits move fast when desperation bites.”  

She kept her eyes on the road ahead and said nothing. I could tell she wasn’t convinced. Neither of us believed it was quite that simple.  

I wondered if I should tell her what my gut kept whispering. It warned that the bandits had moved too cleanly and with too sharp a purpose. Someone had set them on us. Someone who knew exactly what they wanted. But I swallowed the words. Denna carried enough of her own silences. I would not pile mine into her arms.  

“The one with the black beard,” I said after a moment, trying to sound casual. “I’ve seen him before. He was a caravan guard who turned mercenary. My guess is he fell on hard times and traded his coin for sharp steel and heavier crimes.” I tried to keep my tone light, but the words rang hollow in my mouth.  

The silence returned heavier than before. It lingered between us like a weight neither of us dared to name.  

The rugged crags forced us to slow to a crawl. Jagged stones bit at my boots, and Denna’s cloak caught in the wind. The sun gave light but no warmth, and my feet ached with every step on the uneven ground. At last we reached an old pass high in the hills. From the narrow path, we could see far into the valley below.  

I almost missed it at first. A flicker of movement in the canyon below caught my eye, too organized to be natural. I stopped in my tracks and scanned the hollow below. Then I saw it. Rows of tents stood in neat formation, their campfires burning low. Armed men moved among them with purpose. A camp.  

I dropped into a crouch, motioning to Denna to kneel beside me. “There must be at least five hundred soldiers down there,” I murmured, my stomach sinking as I counted the tents. The men moved in clusters, and their steel caught glints of pale sunlight.  

“Do you recognize the uniforms?” she asked softly.  

“No,” I said, shaking my head. But something else caught my eye. A pale banner snapped in the wind above a large white pavilion at the center of the camp. I froze. It was trimmed in silver and emblazoned with a coiled serpent.  

“Jakis,” I said grimly. “That many troops this close to Renere means he must be working with Fascino.”  

I stood abruptly, my voice taut with urgency. “We’ve lost too much time already. We need to get back to Renere.”  

Denna nodded, but her gaze remained fixed on the camp below, her eyes sharp with thought. The wind stirred, snapping the banner once more. The serpent on it seemed to coil even tighter.
