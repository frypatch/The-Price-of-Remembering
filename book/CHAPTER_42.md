# CHAPTER 42

## SEVEN WORDS FOR SILENCE  

WE LAY THERE in the endless desert, the sun a hot hammer beating down on both of us. I kept Denna’s hand in mine, as if the contact alone was enough to keep her tethered to the world. Around us, the sand shimmered, an ocean without a shore. Somewhere far away, I could hear the dry screaming of the wind, but here, where we lay, there was only silence. A silence I dreaded, because I knew it would grow deeper if Denna took her last breath.  

The thirst was maddening. My lips were split and bleeding, each swallow catching in my throat like broken glass. I tried not to think of it. Eyes half-lidded, thoughts dulled by exhaustion, I reached out to the world. I searched for water with every scrap of Naming I could summon. I felt the deep pull of the sand, but the water buried there was too far down. Too far to hear. Too far to Name.  

Denna stirred beside me, drawing in a sharp, ragged breath. I turned to her and saw her lips moving faintly, though no words came. For a moment, I thought she was leaving me already. Then I heard it. A strange throaty chanting, carried faintly by the wind. My cracked mind dismissed it as delirium, but it was real. The rhythm of the voices shifted and grew louder, closer.  

Strength I didn’t know I had flared in me, enough to lift my ruined hand into the air. I waved it weakly, felt the dried blood crack along my bandaged fingers. “Help!” My voice came out hoarse, more a whisper than a shout. I tried again, biting through the pain of my parched throat. “Please… help us…”  

For what felt like an eternity, nothing changed. Then a figure stepped into view, blotting out the sun.

The Tahl saved us. There’s no simpler way to say it. They gave us water, breaking the flask over our lips and letting it trickle down slowly. Denna sputtered but swallowed, though I could see the fever in her eyes, burning too brightly. They gave us food—flat bread and a spiced mash I couldn’t name. Denna managed only a few bites. I ate more, though my hands trembled the whole time.  

Trying to talk to the Tahl was like trying to make a bridge out of wind. I tried everything—Aturan, Temic, even broken Chaeldish—but they only stared back at me, uncomprehending. Finally, one of their women, older and gray-haired, gestured for me to wait. When she returned, she signed in halting Adem hand-talk: slow, deliberate, each motion deliberate and careful.  

*Help her,* I pleaded in the silent, sharp hand-language. *Please.*  

Her sharp eyes softened. She crouched beside Denna and examined her wounds, her hands sure and steady. Then, without a word, she rose and went to speak with the others. Their voices grew heated, the cadence of disagreement clear even though I couldn’t understand their tongue. When the old woman returned, she was flanked by two men, broad and grim-faced. They carried Denna delicately, almost reverently, onto a makeshift stretcher. Her lips parted slightly, murmuring something faint and unintelligible, her brow beaded with sweat.  

We walked for hours beneath the failing sun, the stretch of endless desert giving way at last to clusters of trees. They were strange things, the trees of the Tahl oasis: broad, flat-topped, with bark that gleamed faintly silver beneath the last slanting rays of light. There was sound among the trees—not the dry rustle of leaves, but something more, an eerie, melodic hum like low voices caught on the breeze.  

The nomads brought us into the heart of their encampment. Tents and yurts sprawled around the faint sparkle of the oasis, where water glinted in the moonlight. They carried Denna into the shade. Despite the relief from the sun, she worsened—her fever spiked, her words turning to desperate, senseless babble. Her hand found mine, gripping weakly as I knelt beside her.  

A woman approached, older than the oldest I’d ever seen, her skin marked by deep lines, her eyes sharp despite her years. She crouched low, placing a wrinkled hand on Denna’s forehead.  

“She is very weak,” she said in broken Aturan, her voice a quiet rasp.  

My heart clenched. “I’ve heard… there are healers among your people,” I said, the words trembling as they left my lips. “People who can work magic. Please. Is there nothing you can do for her?”  

The woman’s mouth pulled into a faint, almost apologetic smile. “There were days when we could heal almost anything,” she said. “We sang songs strong enough to make the trees sway, to make the river sing. But those days are long behind us. What strength we have left is faint. A shadow of what it once was.”  

I pressed my hand against the dirt, leaning toward her. “I will take a shadow over nothing,” I said, my voice hardening with desperation. “Please. Will you try? That’s all I ask of you.”  

She studied me for a long moment. Then, with a tired sigh, she placed her hand over mine. “I will gather the others,” she said.  

### * * *  

Night fell. Flames bloomed high and bright as the nomads built their circle of pyres in the sand. The firelight danced against the silver bark of the Singing Trees, which now swayed with a wind that wasn’t there. The hum of their branches became sharper, rising and falling like a strange orchestra tuning itself before a performance.  

Denna lay at the center of the circle, her skin pale, her breath rasping faintly in her chest. Five women emerged from the tents, long shadows cast behind them. Dark storm-colored shifts hung loose around their frames. They entered the ring like ghosts, and silence fell over the camp.  

Their song began low and mournful, like mist curling off the edge of the sea. Slow and aching, it wound its way through the air. The Singing Trees seemed to recognize it, harmonizing faintly, a growing whisper of counterpoint. The wind pulsed stronger, carrying the song higher, pulling me into it. It filled my chest and bones with vibration, and something deep and primal tore free within me.  

The Witch Women raised their voices. Faster, louder. The fire bent inward, as though reaching for Denna, and the wood of the Singing Trees began to groan and creak. Then, one cry broke through the thrumming: sharp and pained. One of the women collapsed, her breath taken. Then another, until all five lay still, and the air softened. The wind died. The song ended.  

Taeylia stepped forward, leaning heavily as if years had been added to her long life. She knelt beside Denna, placing her hands against her chest. A long quiet stretched between us. When she stood again, I saw the sorrow already written across her face.  

“She is too far gone,” Taeylia said softly. “Our song will ease her pain for a night. Perhaps a day. Beyond that, we can give no more.”  

I nodded, the motion hollow. My hands tightened into fists, but I didn’t beg. I couldn’t. I knew she spoke true.  

“Make use of your time,” Taeylia said, her hand resting briefly on my shoulder.  

### * * *  

I knelt beside Denna. Around us, the fires burned low, their light soft. I watched her face, tracing the faint curve of her lips, the quiver of her breath. My eyes fell to the ground, to a leaf from one of the Singing Trees, pale and smooth and new. Carefully, I plucked it from the dirt and pressed it into her hand.  

Her eyes fluttered open. “What’s this?” she whispered weakly.  

“You wanted a leaf from a Singing Tree,” I said, my voice catching.  

Denna smiled, faint but lovely. “You remembered.”  

“I would always remember you,” I said, the truth cutting as it left me.  

“Sing for me, my Sir Savien,” she whispered, her voice trembling.  

“I love you, Denna. I always have.”  

Tears blurred my vision. Her lips moved faintly, but her eyes were already dimming.  

“Hold me Kvothe,” she said, her voice no more than breath. “I can't die alone.”  

Under the swaying trees, I held her as the fires died.
