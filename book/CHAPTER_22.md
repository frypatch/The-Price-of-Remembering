# CHAPTER 22.

## INTERLUDE.

## CROSSCURRENTS.


KOTE FELL SILENT, and a quiet settled over the Waystone Inn. It was the brittle stillness that follows a wound. It was the kind that settles into the wood and waits. He stood and drifted to the bar. Perhaps he only meant to keep his hands busy. But cloth in hand, his motions slowed.  

Chronicler sat at the hearth table, pen resting but not put away. The fire beside him had burned down to a dull orange murmur. He had the careful stillness of a man who knows that pressing too soon will close a door.  

Bast spoke from near the hearth, lazy as his posture. “You made a promise, Reshi. Before the duel. You said you wouldn’t waste another moment.”  

The innkeeper didn’t look up. “I did.”  

“I don’t recall you straining your back over it,” Bast said, a little too lightly.  

“Only fools keep all their promises.” A dry, tired smile. “But I kept that one.” He folded the cloth, turned it once, twice in his hands. “As time permitted.” He let the phrase sit for a moment. “Which is no kind of permission at all.”  

Bast made a quiet sound, not quite agreement.  

“But I did try,” he said, setting the cloth down. “So did she.”  

A sideways look from Bast. “Wilem blamed you for taking twice as long to do anything useful.”  

“Because I was chasing ghosts, Bast,” Kote said, an edge surfacing briefly in his voice. “We all were. Ghosts in noble colors. Ghosts in crests and corridors. Ghosts with rearranged names.” He paused, and for a breath he wasn’t quite Kote. “I found her arguing with a spice merchant.” His hands pressed flat against the bar. “She was furious. Said his cinnamon was a fraud. Claimed it tasted like sawdust steeped in regret.”  

Chronicler’s pen moved, then stopped. Across the room, a laugh slipped out of Bast before he could catch it. “That sounds more like her than anything else you’ve said today.”  

Something eased in Kote’s face. “By the end of it, she had a free pouch of Clovian cinnamé and a crowd of ten arguing whether flavor counts as moral bankruptcy.” He chuckled once, breath hitching in his chest. “She never did like to lose an audience.”  

“And she wasn’t furious with you?”  

His fingers found the edge of the bar and rested there. “She just grinned,” he said. “Like she’d won something she had no right to. Then took my arm like it had always been hers and asked if I’d learned anything worth hearing while I was off getting stabbed.”  

Neither of them spoke for a moment. Outside, the wind called at the shutters and went unanswered.  

Kote smiled. “We started meeting after that. It became habit. Not every night. But often enough.” He paused, and when he spoke again the words came slower, as if he were finding them in a room he hadn’t entered in a long time. “Shuttered teahouses. Ivy-walled gardens no one guarded after dusk. A river bridge where candles drifted on the water. Never delaying what I meant to do. Only what I should have.”  

Bast looked over, more wary than before. “None of us knew.”  

“That’s how she wanted it,” Kote said. “And if I had to choose, I didn’t mind.” He picked up a bottle he didn’t need to polish and held it against the low light. “It was the only part of Renere where the ghosts couldn’t follow. No politics. No princes. Just quiet music.”  

“That’s what she was to you,” Bast said, almost carefully. “The part of the story that hadn’t gone wrong yet.”  

Kote shook his head. “No,” he said. “She’s never been that.” He set the bottle gently behind the bar.  

“But for a little while,” he said, “we met where the city forgot to watch us.”  

He looked down at the polished wood beneath his hands. Ran his thumb across a grain like music half-remembered.  

“And that,” he said softly, “was close enough.”
