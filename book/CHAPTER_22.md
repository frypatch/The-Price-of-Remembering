# CHAPTER 22

## INTERLUDE

## CROSSCURRENTS

IN THE QUIET OF THE Waystone Inn, Kote polished the bar with slow, thoughtful strokes. Slow as sleep. Slow as memory. Behind him, the fire cracked, shadows slipping gold across the walls like thoughts he never quite chased to ground.

“You made a promise,” Bast said, voice lazy as his posture but sharp around the edges. “Before the duel. You said you wouldn’t waste another moment.”

Kote didn’t look up. “I did.”

“I don’t recall you straining your back over it,” Bast said, too casual to be kind.

Kote gave a dry, drowsy smile. “Only fools keep all their promises,” he said. “But I kept that one.”

Bast arched an eyebrow, skeptical.

Kote picked up the cloth, turned it once, twice in his hands. “As time permitted.” He turned the phrase like it tasted strange. “Which is no kind of permission at all.”

He set the cloth down.

“But I did try,” he said, almost to himself. “So did she.”

Bast tilted his head. “Wilem blamed you for taking twice as long to do anything useful.”

“Because I was chasing ghosts, Bast,” Kote said, and his eyes didn’t quite stay focused on the room. “That’s what we were all doing. Ghosts in noble colors. Ghosts in crests and corridors. Ghosts with rearranged names.”

His hands stilled on the bar, the memory already unspooling.

"I found her arguing with a spice merchant. She was furious. Said his cinnamon was a fraud. Claimed it tasted like sawdust steeped in regret.”

Bast barked a laugh. “That sounds more like her than anything else you’ve told me.”

Kote allowed a smile, softer now. “By the end of it, she had a free pouch of Clovian cinnamé and a crowd of ten arguing whether flavor counts as moral bankruptcy.”

He chuckled once, breath caught in the ribs.

“She never did like to lose an audience.”

“And when she saw you?”

“She didn’t blush. She grinned,” he said. “Like someone caught stealing fire and not particularly sorry about it.”

“Did she say anything?”

“She said, ‘About time.’ Then she took my arm like it had always been hers, and asked if I’d learned anything worth hearing while I was off getting stabbed.”

The room went quiet again for a moment.

Kote smiled. “We started meeting after that. It became habit. Not every night. But often enough. Shuttered teahouses. Ivy-walled gardens no one guarded after dusk. A river bridge where candles drifted like fallen stars. Nothing planned, nothing chased. Never delaying what I meant to do. Only what I should have.”

Bast looked over, more wary than before. “None of us knew.”

“That’s how she wanted it,” Kote said. “And if I had to choose, I didn’t mind.”

He picked up a bottle he didn’t need to polish, turned it in his hands once. Twice.

“It was the only part of Renere untouched by shadows. No ghosts followed us there. No politics. No princes. Just laughter. Shared lies. Quiet music.”

“That’s what she was to you,” Bast said. “Something untouched. Something pure.”

Kote shook his head. “No,” he said. “She’s never been that.”

He turned the bottle one last time, then set it gently behind the bar.

“But for a little while,” he said, “we met where the city forgot to watch us.”

He looked down at the polished wood beneath his hands. Ran his thumb across a grain like music half-remembered.

“And that,” he said softly, “was close enough.”
