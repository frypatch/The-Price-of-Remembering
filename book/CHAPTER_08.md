# CHAPTER 8.

## RARE THINGS VANISH.


I WOKE WITH MUSIC in my veins and a question burning on my tongue. Where could I find Denna today?

There are mornings when the world feels newly-minted, and even a threadbare room above Anker’s hums with promise. Sunlight slipped through the shutters, painting gold across the battered neck of my lute. I wondered, not for the first time, what song might find Denna today. What tune I could shape from wood and string that would draw her near.

The day before sparkled crisp and clear in my memory. Laughter twined with song and a score of flavors were shared across Imre’s scattered tables. At parting, there was Denna’s lips, a sudden, starlit touch. It was the kind of day that makes a man believe that perhaps, this time, the story is taking a turn for the better.

As I dressed, hope made me foolish and I was happy because of it. I rehearsed clever observations, half-remembered poetry, and a compliment carefully crafted to slip past the sharpness of her wit. Maybe I would find her sunning herself on Stonebridge, or browsing the bookstalls, or picking her way through the market square with that smile that cut the dust like light. I tuned my lute softly and practiced a phrase I hoped she might coax from me.

After yesterday, every street in Imre felt greener, every errand a possible encounter. I told myself she would be there. Of course she would.

But noon came and Denna did not. The city spun on heedlessly as I wandered past the bakery where we’d shared a sweetroll and through the alley’s hush where her laugh had once echoed. With each step, expectation faded and old uncertainty crept in where promise had been.

I found myself back at Anker’s by habit. Laurel was setting fresh bread on a table and caught my eye.

“Kvothe,” she said quietly, pausing with tray in hand. “I’ve something for you. A message, left this morning.” She held out a page folded small and neat, still faintly warm from her palm.

Denna’s hand. Just two words, hurried yet careful as string drawn tight.

> “Next time.”

I turned the note over, searching for more, even though I knew there wouldn’t be. There wouldn’t be an explanation. No mention of why she had been near enough to leave a note but wouldn't say goodbye. Just a promise so light it seemed a mercy, or perhaps a curse.

“She said she was leaving?” I managed, though the answer was plain in the empty air.

Laurel reached out to comfort me, sympathy soft around her eyes. “She only gave me this and said that you’d understand.”

If I understood anything, it was that doors open and doors close. And Denna was always caught between them, a shadow in the doorway. Never fully arriving, but never truly gone.

I watched the words blur on the page. Ink and memory, smudged by grief. The paper fit quietly into my jacket. I pressed my hand to it, as if her absence could be carried, close and warm. But the city’s music had lost its sweetness. Something rare had vanished.

By midafternoon, I found my feet drifting toward Devi’s. It wasn’t wise, and it definitely wasn’t fair, not to her and not to myself. Still, the bitter hollow Denna left behind was unbearable.

### * * *

Devi’s room always felt alive, but in a way I could never entirely trust. Cinnamon softened the sharper edges of whatever alchemy worked in the shadows, but it did little to cover the tension coiled within the space itself. It was the kind of room that invited curiosity the way a sharp knife invites wandering fingers.

Devi lounged in her chair, her hair spilling over one shoulder in a lazy river of ink, legs tucked beneath her like a cat waiting to pounce. Her grin, sharp and knowing, widened as I entered. “Kvothe,” she said, drawing out my name like a silken thread. “To what do I owe this charming distraction?”

“You flatter me too easily,” I said, leaning against the doorframe.

“Not a word of it is undeserved,” she countered, propping one elbow on the table beside her. “And don’t think you can distract me from the most pressing matter at hand.”

“Which is?”

She waved a finger toward me. “Your hair, darling boy. It’s practically shouting mischief.”

“Mischief,” I said, stepping further into the room, “is just what happens when genius doesn’t sit still.”

“And trouble,” she chimed, “is what happens when it does.”

Our laughter warmed the air briefly. With Devi, words became a game—a rhythmic trade of edges and smiles. For all her talk of danger, she had a way of softening sharp conversations into comfortable unsteadiness.

But soon, as was often the case with Devi, the talk turned deeper. It wasn’t long before the Four-Plate Door came up, that lingering riddle at the heart of my days and nights in the Archives. Devi’s grin shifted, growing tighter, though her eyes grew hungrier. “Do you know what no one tells you about the Archives?” she said, voice low and conspiratorial. “It’s pruned.”

“Pruned?”

Devi tilted her head, the firelight catching one side of her face in gold and leaving the other in deep shadow. “Books are locked away. Secrets buried. Oh, they’ll let you play with what’s safe, sweet boy. But the rest? Tucked far out of reach.”

Her grin stretched as she added, “Far from hands like yours.”

There was something different in her smile this time. Something tighter, restrained. It didn’t sit right. “And you know this… how?” I asked, my voice light but probing.

Devi didn’t answer right away. She reached for a jar on the low table beside her, gently tipping it back and forth, making the liquid inside swirl and shimmer. “Sweet boy,” she said, her voice soft, “you’ve barely crawled through the door, and already you want the whole house.”

“What are they hiding?” I pressed.

“You’re not ready for an answer like that,” she said, her voice low and thick as honey. “And I’m not in the mood to offer one.”

Her deflection didn’t surprise me. Devi loved her secrets too much to give them up easily. But my instincts were growing sharper, and I watched her face closely as I steered the conversation toward Lorren and his brass keys. Just the mention of his name was enough to make the corner of her mouth twitch, her fingers stopping mid-tap. There was a story there, I could feel it.

“Careful, sweet boy,” she said, her voice soft but her eyes dangerous. “Some stones aren’t meant to be turned. You might find sharp things hiding underneath.”

The grin on her face never wavered, but her voice held a chill I hadn’t expected. I pressed her, slowly, delicately, and she let something slip—deliberately or not, I couldn’t quite tell.

“There’s power in keeping things hidden,” she said, her words like a thread caught on a rough edge, fraying just a bit. “But not everyone who hides something deserves to be trusted. Men like Lorren only show you the parts of themselves that they want you to see.”

It wasn’t until much later, after I’d left her, that I realized Devi had been speaking less to me and more to the twist in her memory. Her words rang louder in the spaces between them. They always did.

### * * *

I left with more questions than I came with. That’s how walking into Devi’s den always worked. It was easy to go in, but I always left feeling weighed down. Still, she had pointed me just enough toward the threads I couldn’t resist pulling.

Back in my small, rented room, I retrieved Auri’s book. Its plain, weathered cover concealed a strange warmth and a faint sense of rightness. Not everyone would sense that warmth, but I imagined Auri had known it the moment she placed the book in my hands.

I worked quickly, binding it with a sympathetic thread marked faintly with my own blood. A tool needs to be tied to its maker, and I intended this book to serve a singular purpose: to disappear.

The next day, I approached Lorren’s Giller, Dystrol, holding the book as though it had been unearthed from a dusty corner of some forgotten collection. “A donation,” I said, tracing its etched scrollwork as I spoke. I murmured something about the Amyr while his practiced, neutral face gave away nothing. The only sign was the smallest hesitation when his fingers touched the cover, just a slight pause and a momentary tightness in his grip.

Within days, it vanished, just as I had hoped.

### * * *

The compass remained steady in my hand, its needle pointing resolutely as I slipped between shelves and down familiar corridors of the Archives. It pulled with the certainty of someone who knows a secret and doesn’t care to explain it.

And when it froze, I found myself in front of the Four-Plate Door.

I stopped, my pulse roaring in my ears. For a moment, I hoped that the compass had faltered, that I’d miscalibrated or made some fatal error. But no. The needle’s stillness was absolute. I pressed my trembling hand against the cold, unyielding stone of the door, its edges sharp and precise under my fingertips, as if taunting me for misunderstanding its purpose all my life.

The book was here. Beyond this impenetrable barrier.

My stomach twisted. I had spent years inside these endless halls of parchment and ink, trusting that the Archives contained all truth, all knowledge, open to those worthy and persistent enough to find it. The University had sold me the dream that all the world’s wisdom lay waiting for those who sought it with diligence and care. But this? This made a mockery of that.

I felt heat rise in my chest, a slow and simmering anger. They called the Archives a library of everything, but that had been a lie. This door, this smooth and silent barrier, was proof that knowledge was not simply out of reach. It was hidden. Censored. Scrubbed clean.

I had believed in Lorren’s rules once. Trusted his cold, immovable logic. But no longer. The door was a betrayal of that trust. A trick. A sleight of hand designed to make fools of the curious. The thought left me hollow and seething at the same time.

I felt small then, standing in the vast, quiet belly of the Archives. Foolish for having bought the lie so completely. And yet beneath the sharp sting of betrayal, determination began to simmer. The truth had been withheld from me, but it was still there, trapped behind this unbreachable wall like a secret whispered into stone.

“This wasn’t how it was supposed to work,” I muttered under my breath. My voice barely registered in the stillness. But the door didn’t care. It wouldn’t answer me, wouldn’t unlock, wouldn’t relent.

The Archives were a lie.

My hand fell to my side, curling into a fist. I stayed there a long moment, staring at the door. The urge to scream or strike the smooth, unyielding surface flashed briefly, but I swallowed it down. Anger would accomplish nothing. Not yet.

I turned on my heel and left without looking back. But as I wove through the darkened stacks again, one thought began to solidify beneath all the others. The door may have kept me out, but it couldn’t do so forever. They had hidden something behind that stone to stop people like me. Now, more than ever, I was determined to know why.

One way or another, I would find a way inside.
