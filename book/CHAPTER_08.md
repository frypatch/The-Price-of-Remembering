# CHAPTER 8.

## RARE THINGS VANISH.


I WOKE WITH SUNLIGHT warm on my face and the day before still sparkling in my memory. My heart was light for the first time in months, and when Denna had rested her head against my shoulder, everything finally felt right. It was the kind of day that makes a man believe the story is taking a turn for the better.  

As I dressed, I wondered what other songs I knew that might stir her heart the way yesterday’s had. Hope made me foolish and I was happy because of it. I rehearsed clever observations, half-remembered poetry, and a compliment carefully crafted to slip past the sharpness of her wit. Maybe I would find her sunning herself on Stonebridge, or browsing the bookstalls, or picking her way through the market square with that smile that made every street seem cleaner. I tuned my lute softly and practiced a phrase I hoped she might coax out of me.  

But noon came and Denna did not. The city spun on heedlessly as I wandered past the bakery where we’d shared a sweetroll and lingered on Stonebridge to watch the poleboats drift by. As I walked, expectation faded and left cracks where my old doubts crept back in.  

By midday I’d returned to Anker’s, my search fruitless. Laurel was setting fresh bread on a table and caught my eye.  

“Kvothe,” she said quietly, pausing with tray in hand. “I’ve something for you. A message, left this morning.” She held out a page folded small and neat.  

> “Next time.”  

I watched the words blur on the page. A drop fell, smudging the ink. Tucking the paper into my jacket, I pressed my hand to it, as if her absence could be carried. “She said she was leaving?” I managed, though the answer was already plain.  

Laurel reached out to comfort me, sympathy soft around her eyes. “I asked if she wanted me to wake you, but she wouldn’t let me. She only gave me this and said that you’d understand.”  

If I understood anything, it was that doors open and doors close. And Denna was always caught between them, a shadow in the doorway. Never fully arriving, but never truly gone.  

By midafternoon, I found my feet drifting toward Devi’s. It wasn’t wise, and it definitely wasn’t fair, not to her and not to myself. Still, the bitter hollow Denna left behind was unbearable.  

### * * *  

Even without the windows, Devi’s room always felt alive. Today, the sympathy lamps cast sharp shadows from her piles of books, and wisps of cinnamon incense worked harder than usual as they curled through the air. I heard the chimes before I saw them, a new effort in her losing battle with the butcher below.  

Devi lounged in her usual chair, legs tucked beneath her. Her grin widened as I entered. “Kvothe,” she said, drawing out my name. “To what do I owe this charming distraction?”  

“You flatter me too easily,” I said, leaning against the doorframe.  

“Not a word of it is undeserved,” she countered, propping one elbow on the table beside her. “And don’t think you can distract me from the most pressing matter at hand.”  

“Which is?”  

She waved a finger toward me. “Your hair, darling boy. It’s practically shouting mischief.”  

“Mischief,” I said, stepping further into the room, “is just what happens when genius doesn’t sit still.”  

“And trouble,” she chimed, “is what happens when it does.”  

For a moment, our laughter warmed the air. With Devi, words were a game, a dance of edges and smiles. But with Devi, easy talk never lasted, and before long, the conversation found its way to that riddle in the heart of the Archives. The Four-Plate Door, and the silence that surrounded it.  

“Do you know what no one tells you about the Archives?” Her voice dropped, conspiratorial. “They prune it.”  

“Pruned?” The word tasted strange. I tried to shape it into something sensible, but it slipped away.  

Devi tilted her head, the pale light from the sympathy lamp catching one side of her face and leaving the other in deep shadow. “There are books locked away. Secrets buried. Oh, they’ll let you play with what’s safe, sweet boy. But the rest? Tucked far out of reach.”  

She leaned back, satisfied. “Far from hands like yours.”  

There was something different in her smile this time. Tighter. More restrained. “And you know this? How?” I asked, pushing just a little further.  

Devi didn’t answer right away. She reached for the blanket draped over the back of her chair, pulling it around her legs despite the warmth of the room. “Sweet boy,” she said, her voice soft, “you’ve barely crawled through the door, and already you want the whole house.”  

She wasn’t wrong, but I couldn’t leave it alone. “What are they hiding?” I pressed.  

“You’re not ready for an answer like that,” she said, and her smile didn’t waver. “And I’m not in the mood to offer one.”  

Her deflection didn’t surprise me. Devi loved her secrets too much to give them up easily. But I watched her face closely as I steered the conversation toward Lorren and his keys. Just the mention of his name was enough to make the corner of her mouth twitch, her fingers stopping mid-adjustment on the blanket. There was a story there, I could feel it.  

“Careful, sweet boy,” she said, the words light but her eyes dangerous. “Some stones aren’t meant to be turned. You might find sharp things hiding underneath.” Then she let something slip, though whether deliberately or not, I couldn’t quite tell. “There’s power in keeping things hidden,” she spat, then caught herself, her voice softening. “But not everyone who hides something deserves to be trusted. Men like Lorren only show you the parts of themselves that they want you to see.”  

It wasn’t until much later, after I’d left her, that I realized Devi had been speaking less to me and more to the twist in her memory. Her words rang louder in the spaces between them. They always did.  

### * * *  

Back in my small, rented room, I retrieved Auri’s book. Its plain, weathered cover concealed a strange warmth and a faint sense of rightness. Not everyone would sense that warmth, but I imagined Auri had known it the moment she placed the book in my hands.

I worked quickly, binding it with a sympathetic thread marked faintly with my own blood. A tool needs to be tied to its maker. I intended this book to serve only one purpose, which was to disappear.

The next day, I approached Lorren’s Giller, Dystrol, holding the book as though it had been unearthed from a dusty corner of some forgotten collection. “A donation,” I said, tracing its etched scrollwork as I spoke. I murmured something about the Amyr while his practiced, neutral face gave away nothing. The only sign was the smallest hesitation when his fingers touched the cover, just a slight pause and a momentary tightness in his grip.

Within days, it vanished, just as I had hoped.

### * * *

The compass remained steady in my hand, its needle pointing resolutely as I slipped between shelves and down familiar corridors of the Archives. It pulled with the certainty of someone who knows a secret and doesn’t care to explain it.

And when it froze, I found myself in front of the Four-Plate Door.

I stopped, my pulse roaring in my ears. For a moment, I hoped that the compass had faltered, that I’d miscalibrated or made some fatal error. But no. The needle’s stillness was absolute. I pressed my trembling hand against the cold, unyielding stone of the door, its edges sharp and precise under my fingertips, as if taunting me for misunderstanding its purpose all my life.

The book was here. Beyond this impenetrable barrier.

My stomach twisted. I had spent years inside these endless halls of parchment and ink, trusting that the Archives contained all truth, all knowledge, open to those worthy and persistent enough to find it. The University had sold me the dream that all the world’s wisdom lay waiting for those who sought it with diligence and care. But this? This made a mockery of that.

I felt heat rise in my chest, a slow and simmering anger. They called the Archives a library of everything, but that had been a lie. This door, this smooth and silent barrier, was proof that knowledge was not simply out of reach. It was hidden. Censored. Scrubbed clean.

I had believed in Lorren’s rules once. Trusted his cold, immovable logic. But no longer. The door was a betrayal of that trust. A trick. A sleight of hand designed to make fools of the curious. The thought left me hollow and seething at the same time.

I felt small then, standing in the vast, quiet belly of the Archives. Foolish for having bought the lie so completely. And yet beneath the sharp sting of betrayal, determination began to simmer. The truth had been withheld from me, but it was still there, trapped behind this unbreachable wall like a secret whispered into stone.

“This wasn’t how it was supposed to work,” I muttered under my breath. My voice barely registered in the stillness. But the door didn’t care. It wouldn’t answer me, wouldn’t unlock, wouldn’t relent.

The Archives were a lie.

My hand fell to my side, curling into a fist. I stayed there a long moment, staring at the door. The urge to scream or strike the smooth, unyielding surface flashed briefly, but I swallowed it down. Anger would accomplish nothing. Not yet.

I turned on my heel and left without looking back. But as I wove through the darkened stacks again, one thought began to solidify beneath all the others. The door may have kept me out, but it couldn’t do so forever. They had hidden something behind that stone to stop people like me. Now, more than ever, I was determined to know why.

One way or another, I would find a way inside.
