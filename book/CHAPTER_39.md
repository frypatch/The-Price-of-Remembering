# CHAPTER 39

## THE WEIGHT OF SHADOWS  

THE WORLD FOLDED and turned inside out, and I was torn from the decrepit taproom. Haliax didn’t cast a spell, not in any sense I recognized. This magic was old—primal, raw. It turned the air to syrup, thick and heavy, pulling at me like unseen hands. For a moment, I stood empty in a howling void, shaken and weightless, before reality reformed around me.  

Cold air hit my face, sharp as a razor. The darkness peeled away like storm clouds, revealing a jagged outcrop of stone jutting high above the world. The moon hung low on the horizon, swollen and pale, its light cold against the cracked expanse of the mountain landscape. The ground beneath my feet felt wrong—foreign. The stones were too smooth, their edges too sharp, as if the earth here still remembered the Shapers' hands.  

A sputtering red light flared ahead. Haliax held a pale candle in the crook of his shadowed hand, its flame unnaturally bright and crimson, throwing jagged splinters of light across the uneven cliff. “We move,” he said, his voice quiet but cutting, like a sword drawing from its sheath. “There is much yet to do.”  

A hard shove pressed into my back. I turned, unsteady, to find a woman with eyes like frostbitten glass staring at me. Her mouth was covered by a crude stitch of pigskin, leaving her features disturbingly incomplete. Her eyeless smile told me more than words would have anyway. She tilted her head, gesturing with a short silver blade toward the path ahead.  

I stumbled forward, each reluctant step crunching against loose stone. Denna drifted to my side, her face pale and tight, her arms folded against the chill. “I didn’t know,” she whispered, voice low but urgent, like a confession meant for both of us. “I swear, I didn’t know what they were—what he was.”  

“You couldn’t have,” I said, though the words felt heavier than I meant them to. “You trusted him. We both did.”  

Her eyes flicked toward the hulking shapes in the distance—Cinder, Alenta, and the others. Her voice cracked, trembling with something raw. “Kvothe, I never meant for this to happen. I didn’t—”  

“It’s fine,” I said too quickly. “We’ll figure this out. But I need to know everything. What did Ash—what did *he* want from you?”  

Denna hesitated, her gaze locked on the ground as she walked. “Research,” she admitted finally. “He had me looking into old families—names like Loeclos and Laclith. Stories about Lanre, half-forgotten songs. He kept me moving from one city to the next, gathering scraps. At first, I thought it was harmless. Call me naive if you want. I thought... I thought he was helping me.” Denna folded in on herself, her arms tightening. “Now I’m not so sure.”  

I kept my tone neutral. “And the Loeclos Box? How did it end up with him?”  

“I thought it might protect you,” she said, her voice soft and brittle. “There was so much I didn’t understand. He promised it would help, that he’d translate the markings. That it would keep you safe.” Her eyes begged for forgiveness, but I couldn’t find the words to give it.  

Instead, I pressed the question rattling in my skull. “Denna, what do you think they want with us?”  

Her answer didn’t come in words, just a look—a tightening of her lips, a flicker of fear in her eyes. I didn’t need her to say it aloud. She didn’t know.  

Ahead, Cinder turned, his grin sharp and predatory in the moonlight. “Patience,” he called, the word dripping with mockery. “All will be revealed soon enough.”  

I stumbled closer, heat pulling into my chest. It was reckless, but the question boiled over anyway. “Why should we believe anything you say? You’re Chandrian. Betrayers. Murderers. You’ve spent centuries lording over ash and ruin.”  

The grin dropped from Cinder’s face like a stone cast into deep water. Haliax turned slowly, shadows thickening around him, swallowing the light from the crimson flame. The ground trembled beneath his voice. “You think you *know* something?” he seethed. “You speak the Amyr’s lies, parroting their feeble truths. You know nothing, boy.”  

His shadow surged forward, drowning the light of the moon, his presence pressing against me like a storm about to break. “We gave everything,” he hissed, his voice louder now, echoing against the mountains like an ancient wound reopened. “Our lives, our loves, our names, all sacrificed to save those who danced on our graves.”  

“And now you slaughter innocents.” My voice was steel, sharper than I’d expected under the crushing weight of his ire. “Families. Children. Cities turned to ash.”  

He recoiled, just barely, the shadows around him flickering like dying coals. Then his voice softened, quieter than before but hitched with something hollow. “Burn,” he murmured. “Do you think we burn without reason? You would not endure the lives we’ve lived, the memories that bite and gnaw at us like dogs at our heels.”  

It was Denna’s soft gasp that made me look away—a hand pressed to my chest, a pommel digging sharp into my ribs. Usnea leaned close enough that I felt her ice-edged breath against my neck. “Another word, boy,” she hissed from behind her mask, “and I’ll cut her pretty little ears clean off.”  

I didn’t doubt her.  

### * * *  

The silence of the walk stretched for what felt like hours, broken only by the crunch of gravel underfoot. The wind cut cruelly across the mountain face, coiling around us like a living thing. The path led to a flat expanse of raw stone, strewn with outcrops and jagged broken rocks. Haliax came to a stop at its edge, his gaze cutting across the massive plateau below.  

I approached cautiously, peering over the edge. The sight below stopped my breath. A vast flat expanse stretched in every direction, but the center of the plateau held a perfect circle excavated into the earth, surrounded by a ridge of piled stone and dirt. The enormity of it was staggering—its intentional design unmistakable, but its purpose terrifyingly unclear.  

“Come,” Haliax said, his tone calm once more. The rust-veined moonlight lit the edges of his shadow like embers. “It is time.”  

We slid down the crater’s slope, loose earth shifting beneath our boots. Inside the bowl, the space felt even more massive, its center a shrine to quiet, ancient power. Haliax placed a pale candle on the ground first, the red flame flickering unnaturally high in the darkness. Then he lit a second candle, this one a deep, greasy black. Its flame didn’t glow—it darkened. Its mere presence swallowed any light the stars above tried to lend.  

As the black flame burned, shapes began to rise out of the darkness. What I’d thought were scattered stones grew into towering obelisks, forming two concentric rings. At their heart, the largest stone loomed: a massive trilithon, its top lintel spanning larger than Anker’s inn, and beneath it, a curtain of shadows darker than deep night.  

Haliax turned his gaze to the heavens as though tracing some ancient constellation only he could see. The low moon lit his shadow-cloaked form, its light breaking across him like water against rock.  

“The time has come,” he said, his voice low but unyielding. “Bring him and the box to me.”  

Stercus’ hands gripped my arm, the weight of his calloused fingers biting into the bruises beneath my shirt. Alenta seized my other, her fingers cold and unrelenting. They dragged me forward, each step grinding resistance into the loose earth beneath my boots. Haliax stood ominously still, a monolith carved from darkness. From his hand, the black Loeclos Box dangled with all the careless gravity of a blade about to fall.  

“You will open it,” Haliax commanded, his shadow-thick voice slipping past my ribs and settling somewhere deep and unshakable.  

The box seemed to absorb the moonlight, its surface unyielding, alien. “I don’t know how,” I managed through the tight cage of my chest.  

Cinder’s laugh splintered the silence, fractured and sharp as shattering glass. He stepped closer, his pale face alight with cruel delight. “That’s no trouble. We’ll teach you.”  

At Haliax’s imperceptible nod, Alenta gripped my wrist with one hand as her other brought forth a blade, quicksilver under the moon. She drove it cleanly into my palm.  

I screamed, the sound driven from me like wind through a broken pane. The heat of it—searing and alive—was unbearable, a wildfire tearing through nerves and bone. Then came the cold, immediate and unforgiving, a glacier’s breath filling the hollow left by the pain. My fingers hung limp, alien and useless. Crimson drops splattered the ebony box, soaking into its surface like rain into parched soil.  

“Open it,” Haliax repeated, his words more profound than any marked command.  

I remained silent, gasping and dizzy as the weight of the moment began to tilt the world, the box swimming in and out of focus.  

“Open it,” he hissed again, and this time his voice drew tight around my mind like a snare. “Or we will take that same blade to her.”  

His shadow-woven arm extended, pointing past the circle of beasts and figures to Denna, who stood motionless at the edge of the gathering, her hands folded against her chest. The tremor in her stance betrayed her strength.  

“No—” I choked out, then gathered enough air for my next words to feel sharp. “Don’t touch her.”  

“Then heed me.” Haliax’s vow hung heavy. “For every fraction of hesitation, my purpose will be carried out on her instead.”  

I met Denna's gaze then—wide, fearful, and resolutely fixed on me. There was no room for stubborn defiance under that weight. I crumbled. “Edro,” I muttered.  

The lid of the Loeclos Box clicked open with a sound that reverberated through the night, as though the locks of a hundred ancient vaults had suddenly disengaged. I flinched, waiting—expecting fire, light, the shattering wail of forgotten worlds to pour forth. But there was none of that.  

The interior was padded, lined with material dark as pitch and eerie in its perfection, as though no human hand had ever touched it. Nestled within was a single shard of black stone, no larger than Caesura’s shattered tip. Haliax plucked it out with strange reverence, holding it aloft as the moon painted eerie edges across its surface.  

“Our suffering ends tonight,” he announced, the words vibrating like the pluck of a string between the jagged stones. His shadowed figure turned toward Denna, ominous in its simplicity. “Bring her.”  

“No!” I scrambled to my feet, more desperate than I’d ever been. “Take whatever you need from me—just leave her out of this!”  

Haliax surveyed me, his head tilting beneath that gathering void of shadow. When he spoke, his voice softened, which somehow made it all the worse. “For what comes next, Kvothe, you cannot help.”  

Suddenly, I was seized again, thrown aside like a discarded banner. I hit the ground hard, the impact punching air from my lungs. When I recovered enough to look, Denna was standing before him, her frailty outlined in the harsh moonlight.  

“Cinder speaks of your talents,” Haliax said, his tone distant, almost fond. He held out the shard to her, its sharp edge casting an unnatural, liquid gleam. “Now you will sing. Look upon the door, and sing the words that are forsworn there.”  

She faltered, her voice a quaking fragment. “I don’t—”  

“Do not look at it,” Haliax interrupted, seizing her chin with his skeletal hand, forcing her face forward. The dark shape of the ancient stone arch loomed like a mouth against the horizon. “See it!”  

Denna trembled, tears slipping down her cheeks, but her gaze became distant, fixed, as though the arch were rewriting her. Seconds passed, and the silence of the gathering deepened, heavy as an executioner’s hood.  

Dalcenti approached her then, her mask drawn back to reveal her ghostly, ruined face. She whispered something into Denna’s ear, her words sharp and cruel as shattered ice.  

Denna’s eyes widened as they met mine briefly—frantic, questioning, betrayed. And then, like a marionette pulled by its strings, she drew in a long, shuddering breath and opened her mouth.  

What came from her was not song in any way I had ever known it. Three clear notes rippled into the air, cutting and unyielding, impossible in their perfection. They carried the texture of stones grinding beneath deep water, of doors long closed and forgotten creaking wide to let nightmares through. Light thrummed in the space between stone, bending and shivering.  

The black stone arch rippled, its curtain-like darkness bulging outward, swelling toward us as the ground beneath began to shake. A deep, resonating thrum escaped from the door—a heartbeat, dreadful and primal, echoing into bone and marrow.  

Shapes pressed against the dark veil, too strange to process, and then they poured forth: wolves the size of horses, their jaws dripping molten ruin; birds with human teeth glinting through their hooked beaks; spiders tall enough to blot the moon, their eyeless forms scrabbling forward.  

The air cracked again, and through the crowd of horrors, something else emerged. Taller, larger, and infinitely worse—the spindly figure of Iax. His flesh hung in shadowed tatters, his wiry arms stretched unnaturally long, and from beneath a dripping curtain of black hair, his hollowed-out face grinned a mirthless mockery of joy.  

“Welcome, Dreamer,” Haliax said with a strange kind of reverence.  

Iax’s soulless eyes surveyed us, fixing on Haliax. A laugh boiled from his throat, rust on iron, wheezing and jagged. “Lanre,” he said, soft and full of dark humor. “How fitting that you would stand here, among the ruins you wrought, to set me free.”  

Haliax raised the shard of black stone, his voice steady despite the tremor in his shadow. “Not free—not yet. I come seeking your power. Our curse has run long, our torment endless. I ask your boon, Dreamer. Free us.”  

Iax’s laugh deepened into something brutal, scarred and ancient. “Ask, then, hero of old. Tell me, what price would you have me pay for your deliverance?”  

Haliax stood straighter. For the first time, I thought I saw something fragile at his core. “Shatter the curse. Burn these shadows to smoke, and let me pass through the doors of death.”  

Iax considered this, his head tilting farther than it should. With a word—a sound that crushed the very air around it—he took the shard, smote it into dust, and scattered it into the wind.  

The shadow coiling around Haliax melted away, revealing the face of a man who had fallen long before history was written. He reached up, touching his own cheek, a sob escaping his trembling lips. “It has been so long,” Lanre murmured. “Too long.”  

Then, he turned, smiling faintly. “Someone… someone end it.”  

Cinder obliged.  

The blade sank deep, and Lanre collapsed, the bitter smile still gracing his face as shadows stirred and the candle hissed out.
