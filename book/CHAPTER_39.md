# CHAPTER 39.

## THE WEIGHT OF SHADOWS.


THE WORLD BENT itself backward and I fell through the center of nothing.  

There was no spell here, not as the University taught them. This was older magic, the kind that lived in the spaces between heartbeats, in the moment before a candle dies. The air became thick as amber honey, pulling at my bones with patient, ancient fingers. For a breath that lasted forever, I hung suspended in a void that howled without sound, weightless as smoke, heavy as stone.  

Then reality remembered itself, and I landed.  

Cold struck my face like an open palm. The darkness peeled away in layers, each one revealing a jagged outcrop of stone jutting high above the world. The moon hung low on the horizon, swollen and pale, its light cold against the cracked expanse of the mountain landscape. The ground beneath my feet felt foreign. The stones were too smooth, their edges too sharp, as if the earth here still remembered the Shapers' hands.  

A red flame guttered to life ahead, bright as fever-dreams. Haliax cupped it in his shadowed palm, and the light struggled against the darkness that clung to him like a living thing. Where it won free, it threw wild splinters of light across the uneven cliff.  

“We move,” Haliax said. His voice was quiet in the way that deep water is quiet. “There is much yet to do.”  

Something hard pressed between my shoulder blades. I turned to find a woman watching me with eyes like frostbitten glass, cold and clear and pitiless. Pigskin covered her mouth, stitched crude and tight,leaving her features disturbingly incomplete. She tilted her head, a motion too smooth to be entirely human, and gestured forward with a short silver blade toward the path ahead.  

I walked. Each step crunched against loose stone, the sound too loud in the mountain quiet. Denna drifted to my side, her face pale as paper, arms wrapped around herself to ward off the chill.  

“I didn't know,” she whispered. The words came quick and desperate. “I swear to you, Kvothe. I didn't know what they were. What he was.”  

“You couldn't have.” The words felt heavier than I meant them to. “You trusted him. We both did.”  

Her eyes found the shapes moving in the darkness ahead. Cinder. Alenta. The others whose names I'd learned from stories meant to frighten children. Denna's voice cracked, trembling with something raw. “I never meant for any of this.”  

“I know,” I said, though knowing changed nothing.  

She walked in silence for three steps, then four, then five. When she spoke again, her words came halting, like stones across a river. “He had me searching. Old families with older names. Loeclos. Laclith. Songs about Lanre that nobody sings anymore, the kind that make old women cross themselves and look away.” She paused, gathering herself. “I traveled from city to city, collecting pieces of things that made no sense alone. Like gathering smoke in my hands.”  

Her arms tightened around herself, and her voice dropped to barely more than breath. “When you showed me those knots on the box, the ones that you couldn't read, I thought I could help. I thought if could get Master Ash to translate them, then maybe you'd stay.” She stopped, swallowed hard, then started again with words that came out smaller. “Maybe you wouldn't need to go searching elsewhere for answers.”  

The words hit me like cold water. She thought she needed to earn my presence, to purchase my attention with usefulness. As if I wouldn't have stayed simply because she asked. As if I hadn't been hers since the first time I heard her laugh across the caravan's campfire.  

“I wanted to give you a reason to stay,” she whispered, each word a small confession. “I wanted to be the one who helped you.” Her laugh came out broken. “Look how well that turned out.”  

I wanted to ask what they wanted with us, but the question died in my throat. I already knew she had no answer.  

Cinder turned then, his smile sharp as winter wind. “Patience,” he called, the word dripping sweet as poisoned honey. “All things reveal themselves to those who wait.”  

Heat pulled into my chest, reckless and familiar. “Why should we believe anything from you? You're Chandrian. You're nothing but betrayal wearing human faces. Centuries of ash and ruin, and for what?”  

“What do you think they want with us?” I asked, though I already knew she had no answer.  

Her silence was answer enough, but before she could speak, Cinder turned. His smile cut through the darkness sharp as winter wind. “Patience,” he called, the word dripping sweet as poisoned honey. “All things reveal themselves to those who wait.”  

I stumbled closer, and the taste of plum flooded my mouth, sweet and wrong and familiar. The anger came with it, hot and reckless, pushing words past my better judgment. “Why should we believe anything you say? You're Chandrian. Betrayers. Murderers. You've spent centuries lording over ash and ruin.”  

The grin dropped from Cinder’s face like melted wax. Haliax turned slowly, shadows gathering around him thick as funeral shrouds. When he spoke, the mountain itself seemed to lean in to listen.  

“You dare speak of what you know?” The words came out soft at first, then louder, building like a storm. “You parrot the Amyr's lies, their carefully crafted stories. You know nothing, boy. Nothing.”  

His shadow surged forward, swallowing stars. “We gave everything. Our lives. Our loves. Our very names. All of it sacrificed to save people who later danced on our graves.”  

“And now you slaughter innocents.” My voice came out harder than I expected, steel against stone. “Families. Children. Whole cities turned to smoke and memory.”  

He drew back, just barely, shadows flickering like dying coals. When he spoke again, his voice had gone soft and hollow. “Burn,” he murmured. “You think we burn without reason? You could not endure one day of the life we've lived. The memories that follow us like hungry dogs.”  

Then cold steel pressed against my ribs, and Usnea's breath came ice-sharp against my neck. “Another word,” she whispered through her mask, “and I'll take her pretty ears for trophies.”  

I didn’t doubt her.  

### * * *  

Time moves strangely when you're walking toward something terrible.  

The silence of our walk stretched for what felt like hours, broken only by the crunch of gravel underfoot and the sound of our own breathing. The wind cut across the mountain face, alive and bitter, coiling around us like something that had learned to hate. It found every gap in our clothing, every exposed bit of skin, and bit deep with teeth of ice.  

The path led to a flat expanse of raw stone, strewn with outcrops and jagged broken rocks that jutted up like accusations. Haliax stopped at its edge, looking down at something I couldn't yet see.  

I approached carefully, each step measured, and looked over the edge.  

What lay below stole my breath away. Someone or something had carved a circle from the earth itself, precise beyond nature. Stone and dirt piled high around its edges like the walls of an impossible bowl. And at the center of that circle lay a darkness I'd never seen before. Not the darkness of night or the darkness of closed eyes, but something else entirely. Something that made ordinary shadows look pale as noon.  

“Come,” Haliax said, his voice calm as death. “It is time.”  

We slid down the crater’s slope, loose earth shifting beneath our boots. Inside, the space felt larger than it had looked from above, the way fears grow bigger when you face them directly. Haliax placed a pale candle on the ground first, the red flame flickering unnaturally high in the darkness. Then he lit a second candle, this one a deep, greasy black.  

Its flame didn't burn. It darkened.  

The black flame ate light the way silence eats sound, the way forgetting eats memory. As it burned, or whatever word describes what it did instead of burning, shapes began to rise from the darkness. What I'd taken for scattered stones became obelisks, tall and patient, arranged in two perfect circles. And at their heart, the largest stones loomed, a massive trilithon, its top lintel spanning larger than Anker’s inn, and beneath it, a curtain of shadows darker than deep night.  

Haliax looked up at stars I couldn't see, tracing patterns in the sky that meant nothing to me and everything to him.  

“The time has come,” he said. “Bring the boy. Bring the box.”  

Stercus grabbed my left arm, his fingers finding every bruise Cinder had given me. Alenta took my right, her grip cold and final. They dragged me forward, and I fought them with everything except hope.  

Haliax stood still as stone, still as waiting, the Loeclos Box hanging from his hand like a hanged man from a tree.  

“You will open it,” he commanded.  

The box seemed to drink moonlight, its once-beautiful surface now gave back nothing. “I don’t know how,” I managed through the tight cage of my chest.  

Cinder's laugh shattered against the ancient stones. He stepped closer, his pale face alight with cruel delight. “That’s no trouble. We’ll teach you.”  

At some signal I couldn't see, Alenta grabbed my wrist with one hand while the other brought forth her blade. She drove it through my palm in one clean motion, the way you'd push a needle through cloth if the cloth could scream.  

I did scream. The sound tore from me raw and ragged. First came heat, bright and impossible, a star being born in my hand. Then came cold, immediate and absolute, filling the hole the heat had left behind. My fingers went strange and distant, no longer mine, no longer anything.  

Blood fell onto the box in fat drops, and the box drank them down like parched earth drinks rain.  

“Open it,” Haliax said again.  

I said nothing, gasping, the world tilting and swimming.  

“Open it,” he repeated, and this time his voice wrapped around my mind like wire. “Or we give her the same lesson.”  

His shadow-wrapped arm pointed past the circle of monsters to where Denna stood at the gathering's edge, her hands folded against her chest like broken birds.  

“No.” The word came out cracked. Then stronger. “Don't touch her.”  

“Then speak the word you know.”  

I met Denna's eyes. They were wide and frightened and fixed on me with a faith I didn't deserve.  

I closed my eyes and reached out with more than hands. My blood had soaked into the box, and blood remembers. I found the sympathy there, the connection between what was inside me and what was now inside the wood. Like following a thread through a labyrinth, I let my mind flow along those crimson paths.  

The box revealed itself to me in layers. First the grain of the roah wood, tight and twisted as a secret. Then deeper, to the mechanisms hidden within. Three locks, each one listening for something different. The first wanted a word. The second wanted a tone, accurate and precise. The third wanted intention, pure and unflinching.  

I knew it then, completely. Every joint, every hinge, every clever piece of artifice that held it closed. And in that moment of perfect knowing, I felt something more. I could unmake it. Not break it, not destroy it, but unweave it from the world entirely. Make it so it had never been. The knowledge burned in me like a star being born, and I wanted it. Wanted to watch Haliax when the thing he needed simply ceased to exist, had never existed, would never exist.  

But then I saw Denna's face, and the blade still pressed against her throat, and I knew the price of that satisfaction would be paid in her blood. The cost was too high. It would always be too high.  

“Edro,” I whispered, but the word was more than sound. I pitched it to the frequency the second lock craved, shaped it with the intention the third lock demanded. The word fell into the box like a key into its proper lock.  

The Loeclos Box opened with a sound like every lock in the world agreeing to betray its door. I flinched, waiting for fire, for light, for the world to come apart at its seams.  

Instead, there was only darkness lined with material that had never known human touch. And nestled within, a shard of black stone no larger than a broken promise.  

Haliax lifted it out with the reverence reserved for holy things and terrible ones.  

“Our suffering ends tonight,” he announced, the words hanging in the air like smoke. Then he turned to Denna. “Bring her.”  

“No!” I scrambled to my feet, desperate as drowning. “Take whatever you need from me. Leave her out of this.”  

Haliax tilted his head, considering. When he spoke, his voice had gone gentle, which made it infinitely worse. “For what comes next, young man, you are entirely the wrong instrument.”  

They seized me again, threw me aside like a letter already read. I hit the ground hard, the impact punching air from my lungs. When I recovered enough to look, Denna was standing before him, her frailty outlined in the harsh moonlight.  

“Cinder speaks of your talents,” Haliax said, his tone distant, almost fond. He held out the shard to her, its sharp edge casting an unnatural, liquid gleam. “Now you will sing. Look upon the door, and sing the words that are forsworn there.”  

She trembled. “I don't understand.”  

“Look at it.” His shadowed hand caught her chin, turning her face toward the ancient arch. “See it truly.”  

Denna trembled, tears slipping down her cheeks, but her gaze became distant, fixed, as though the arch were rewriting her. Seconds passed, and the silence of the gathering deepened, heavy as an executioner’s hood.  

Dalcenti approached her then, her mask drawn back to reveal her ghostly, ruined face. She whispered something into Denna’s ear and Denna’s eyes found mine one last time. Frantic. Questioning. Betrayed.  

Then, like a marionette pulled by its strings, she drew in a long, shuddering breath and opened her mouth.  

What came from her was not song in any way I had ever known it. Three notes, perfect and terrible, each one written in a language that predated words. They carried the weight of stones grinding beneath oceans, of doors that should never open creaking wide on ancient hinges. The notes hung in the air like hanged men, like prophecies, like the last words of dying gods.  

The black curtain beneath the arch began to move. It bulged outward, pregnant with possibilities that should never be born. The ground shook, not with violence but with recognition, as if the earth remembered what was coming and tried to flee.  

A sound emerged from beyond that door. A heartbeat, if hearts could be the size of mountains. A breathing, if breath could rot the air.  

Then they poured through.  

Wolves the size of horses, their jaws dripping with light that burned. Birds with human teeth strung like pearls in their beaks. Spiders tall enough to cast shadows on the moon, eyeless and eager. Things that had too many joints, or not enough. Things that moved in ways that made my eyes water to follow.  

And then, stepping through them all like a shepherd through his flock, came Iax.  

His flesh hung in tatters that might have been shadows or might have been skin. His arms stretched wrong, too long, too thin, reaching for things that weren't there. From beneath hair black as the space between stars, his face grinned without joy, without humor, without anything that could be called human.  

“Welcome, Dreamer,” Haliax said, and for the first time I heard something like reverence in his voice.  

Iax’s soulless eyes surveyed us, fixing on Haliax. When he laughed, it sounded like rust on iron, like doors that hadn't opened in a thousand years suddenly remembering how. “Lanre,” he said, soft and full of dark humor. “How fitting that you would stand here, among the ruins you wrought, to set me free.”  

Haliax raised the shard of black stone, steady despite the trembling in his shadow. “Not free. Not yet. I come seeking your power, Dreamer. Our curse has run too long, our torment endless. I ask your boon, Dreamer.”  

Iax’s laugh deepened into something brutal, scarred and ancient. “Ask, then, hero of old. Tell me, what price would you have me pay?”  

Haliax stood straighter. For the first time, I thought I saw something fragile at his core. “Shatter the curse. Burn these shadows to smoke, and let me pass through the doors of death.”  

Iax considered this with the patience of someone who had nothing but time. Then he spoke a word that made the air scream, took the shard, and crushed it to dust between fingers that weren't entirely there. The dust scattered on wind that came from nowhere, went nowhere, meant nothing.  

The shadow that had wrapped Haliax for longer than kingdoms had stood began to peel away like paint from a burning house. Beneath it stood a man. Just a man. Old and tired and broken in ways that had nothing to do with bones.  

He reached up with trembling fingers, touched his own cheek like a blind man remembering sight. A sob escaped him, small and private and devastating.  

“It has been so long,” Lanre whispered. “Too long.”  

Then he turned, and on his face was the kind of smile you see on men who've finally put down burdens too heavy to bear.  

“Someone end it,” he said. “Please.”  

Cinder obliged.  

The blade sank deep, and Lanre collapsed, the bitter smile still gracing his face as shadows stirred and the candle hissed out.
