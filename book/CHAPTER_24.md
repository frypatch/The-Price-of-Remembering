# CHAPTER 24

## THE WHISPERING QUARTER

THERE WAS NO threshold marking the entrance to The Whispering Quarter.

No walls, no guardhouses. No watchful merchant guilds staking claim over its streets. You simply stepped forward, and the city around you—real, present, known—began to unmake itself.

The air grew thinner, the streets compacting in on themselves like the folds of a closed book. The roads you could explain led away. The ones that remained could not be explained at all.

Bast hesitated first.

I had been watching the streets. But he had been watching the not streets. The spaces between sound, the places between knowing.

And something there had caught him the way a wolf catches the scent of something that has no living thing to claim its name.

He slowed to a halt the way a man steps carefully across thin ice—suddenly aware that something beneath his feet is shifting.

“Bast?”

His head tilted slightly, eyes narrowing. Not at the street itself, but at the space around it.

“I don’t like this,” he murmured.

“Neither do the begger,” Wilem pointed out. His arms were crossed and a controlled tightness in his breath. "Not even the drunk ones."

Sim rubbed his arms as if an unseen draft had run through them. "This is impossible. There are no secret districts in Renere. The city isn’t built that way."

Bast tilted his head. The lamplight cast sharp shadows against his cheekbones. “No. But this isn’t a district, is it?”

Sim gave a confused scoff. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

Bast ran a hand down the front of his coat as if brushing away dust, gaze flicking toward the street ahead of us. “Borders between places aren’t always… well-behaved.”

There was something in his voice I didn’t like. Something edged with distant knowing.

He exhaled quietly, rolling his shoulders before continuing. “The Fae and the Mortal World aren't just two separate things, divided neatly like streets on a map. There are places where they… bleed into each other.”

Wilem frowned, shifting his weight unconsciously. “Like the Eld?”

Bast let out a small, humorless laugh. “No, the Eld remembers too much. But this?” He tapped his heel softly against the stone beneath him. His expression turned calculated. “**This is a place that has forgotten itself altogether.**”

The words slipped into the empty air like a drop of ink into water, sinking slow and staining the silence around them.

“Forgotten?” Sim muttered, mouth twisting as he tried to parse the meaning.

I caught the way Bast’s fingers ran absently along the edge of his coat, the same way a man keeps a hand near his sword—not threatening, just waiting to see if he’ll need it.

“It happens sometimes,” he continued, voice quieter. “Places don’t just crumble into ruin. Sometimes… they unravel, like threads slipping loose from a weave. Old promises fray. Old bargains weaken. Some roads fold into themselves too many times, and suddenly—” He made a loose, twisting motion with his fingers. “—you get something that doesn’t know whether it should have existed at all.”

He tilted his head backward slightly, scenting at the air.

Sim shivered. “That’s absurd.”

Bast smiled. “Not if you know the stories.”

I exchanged a glance with Wilem. Bast was being too careful. He always had the air of someone who had seen more than he cared to explain, but this wasn’t his usual playacting amusement.

### * * *

We found our perch along the old market district, an empty sprawl of forgotten stalls that had long since given up being useful.

It gave us the vantage we needed—but not the certainty.

The Low-House we suspected Trenati would use was just beyond the dying reach of Renere’s streetlamps. No signs. No mark of allegiance. Only the quiet, unnatural certainty that it had always been there.

Every rule of the city bent around it.

Over the hours, men passed without looking. Footsteps that should have echoed didn’t. Some slowed as they approached the door as if they had forgotten why their feet had carried them there.

Sim stirred beside me, rubbing his arms, frowning like a man trying to shake off a thought before it took shape. "That’s odd."

"What?" I murmured.

"That man near the canopied stall," Sim said. "The one lighting his pipe?"

I followed his gaze. A dark-coated man leaned against a nearby stand, puffing at a twisted-stem pipe. Greenish smoke drifted from his lips, curling against the gray fabric of his collar. He looked utterly at ease. Uninterested.

Sim exhaled sharply. "I swear to Tehlu, I saw that man two streets away. By the theater. He leaned against a different wall, same pipe, smoking just like that."

"Maybe he moved faster than you did," Wil murmured, though he was already shifting, subtly adjusting his line of sight.

Sim dampened his lips. "At the theater, he was smoking the end of a pipe. Here, it’s fully packed, just lit."

That left a thin silence.

Then, something changed. It was as if someone breathed back into the world, and then their figure stepped out of the Low-House.

But, not one of the men we counted. Not someone familiar at all. Someone that should not have existed.

The man turned the corner briskly and passed two chatting women. One of them flicked a glance toward him and hesitated—blinking in slow, startled realization.

“You’re back early,” she said, confused.

The man gave a casual wave, smiling.

“Gods above,” the other woman muttered. “I thought you’d already left town.”

A slow, prickling silence settled between all of us.

Even Sim had caught it. That man was not surprised to be here. He walked with the confidence of someone who knew exactly where he had been.

Only the world itself had lost him.

Wilem, who had been carefully tracking the men entering and not leaving, frowned suddenly.

Then—too harshly—he whispered: “That’s not possible.”

I recognized the tension settling into his shoulders. The kind of weight that falls into someone’s spine right before they realize they've seen something they cannot explain.

“What isn’t?” Sim asked sharply.

Wilem didn’t look up. He wasn’t asking anymore. He was checking.

He flipped back through his notes, fingers pressing into the page. Running the tally a second time. A third. His lips parted slightly, exhaling a slow, careful breath.

“There were twelve,” he muttered, mostly to himself. “I know I counted twelve.”

Sim and I exchanged a glance.

“There were twelve,” I said cautiously.

“Then why are there still twelve inside?” Wil muttered, flipping pages back and forth.

"Numbers don’t lie," Sim said, though he sounded like he wished they did.

Bast, who had been restless beside me, flicked his fingers, face impassive. "Reshi, listen."

I hesitated.

Silence.

That was wrong. The market should not be silent—even this late, even in quieter corners, there should be the scrape of boots on stone, the distant clang of dishes, the ripple of conversations.

But for the space of a lingering breath, there was nothing. As if the city around us had taken a sharp inhale and never exhaled.

Then it returned. Murmurs braided back into the night, a laugh echoed off an empty stone wall. But there had been a moment—a moment where Renere had forgotten to let itself exist.

### * * *

A figure passed, wrapped in a clerk’s coat, carrying a satchel. He paused by a lantern to adjust the clasp with fumbling fingers.

Bored, I followed the movement absently—right up until his fingers touched the clasp.

Then, more movement.

Prince Trenati.

His step was certain. Unhurried. Measured.

And yet—

I felt him fade while watching him move.

The streets did not resist him. They did not mark him passing through.

Instead, I felt the world shifting itself beneath his weight, letting him un-make the proof of his own presence.

Once he walked forward, it did not matter that he had walked before.

I saw him glance towards a passing street vendor.

The man nodded absently—a reflexive motion, the kind of movement you don’t make toward something that has already been erased.

He was still here. In some ways, at least.

“We don’t belong here, Reshi,” Bast murmured.

I kept watching Trenati. “He does.”

Bast laughed under his breath—not his usual laughter. A hollow thing. A space between breath.

“For now,” he said softly. “‘Belonging’ is **a debt this place will come back to collect.**”

Sim let out a quiet breath, shifting his weight. “Do people... come back?”

Bast’s fingers drummed against his trousers. The shrug he offered was empty. Unconvincing.

Wil’s fingers tightened around his notebook. “I don’t like this,” he murmured, barely moving his lips. “We should reposition.”

"Why?" Sim breathed.

"Because we’re too still," he said, voice bare of emotion. "Three men, a single table, no movement. We don’t look like vendors. We don’t look like gamblers. We look like men who are watching something they’re not supposed to see."

I exhaled.

“Wait, no. Too late,” Wilem whispered sharply.

I stiffened. Sim went rigid beside me. 

Wil wasn’t looking at the Low-House anymore. He was looking past it—to the side street where a man had stopped mid-step, eyes locked directly onto us.

A casual passerby wouldn’t stop like that. Wouldn’t hesitate. Wouldn’t study us.

Then—I saw the second man, leaning against a lamp post, pretending to smoke but plainly watching.

The third, the store clerk, began to angle back towards us.

The fourth—the street vendor.

The weight of it settled fast. Too fast.

“They’re not just watching Trenati,” Sim whispered, barely breathing the words. “They’re watching for people watching him.”

And now… we were the ones being watched.

Wil tensed beside me. “We move now.”

We turned—but too late. The second man flicked his wrist twice, and the others reacted without hesitation.

One moment, the alley was clear.

The next, we weren’t alone.

The first man stepped in behind us, cutting off the exit. The doorman peeled away from his post by the Low-House and began crossing toward us, a purpose in his stride.

We were surrounded.

I measured our odds—not good. Not in this tight space. Not against four watchers who had been expecting trouble.
