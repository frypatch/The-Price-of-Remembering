# CHAPTER 24.

## THE WHISPERING QUARTER.


THERE WAS NO BORDER where the Whispering Quarter began.  

No walls. No guardhouses. No watchful merchant guilds staking claim over its streets. You simply stepped forward, and the city around you, though it still felt familiar, began to unravel.  

The air grew thinner. The streets pressed closer. The roads you could name folded in on themselves, like the pages of a closed book. The only paths that remained led to places no one could explain.  

I felt it then. The faint tremor returning to my fingers. The nahlrout from earlier had burned down to nothing.  

I pulled the flask from my coat. It had been Bast’s idea, though he’d never quite said so. He had simply set a stoppered bottle on the table that morning and let it sit there until I picked it up.  

The tea was cold. It tasted the way a dead fire smells, all char and no warmth. I forced a mouthful down. My throat closed against it. But within a few breaths, my hands steadied. The cut along my forearm went quiet. The world returned its edges to me, reluctantly, like a miser parting with coin.  

Bast hesitated first.  

I had been watching the streets. But he had been watching the *not* streets. The spaces between sound, the places between knowing. And something there had caught him. Something with no name he was willing to say aloud.  

He slowed, then stopped, careful as a man testing thin ice.  

“Bast?”  

His head tilted slightly, eyes narrowing. Not at the street itself, but at the space around it.  

“I don’t like this,” he murmured.  

We had passed three doorways since the last cross street. Each one recessed, each one the kind of shallow alcove where beggars stake their ground in any city worth the name. All empty. Not even a blanket left behind.  

“Neither do the beggars,” Wilem pointed out. His arms were crossed. His breathing was careful. “Not even the drunk ones.”  

Sim rubbed his arms against a chill that wasn’t there. “This is impossible. There are no secret districts in Renere. The city isn’t built that way.”  

The lamplight cast sharp shadows against Bast’s cheekbones. “No. But this isn’t a district, is it?”  

Sim blinked. “Then what is it?”  

Bast ran a hand down the front of his coat as if brushing away dust. “Borders between places aren’t always well-behaved.”  

There was something in his voice I didn’t like. Something old. Something Fae.  

He rolled his shoulders before continuing. “The Fae and the mortal are not so neatly parted as you think. There are places where the one bleeds slowly into the other.”  

Wilem frowned, shifting his weight. “Like the Eld?”  

Bast let out a small, humorless laugh. “The Eld remembers too well. But this place has forgotten itself altogether.”  

The words sank into the quiet like ink into a page.  

Sim straightened beside me. “Forgotten?” he muttered. “What does that even mean?”  

Bast’s fingers ran absently along the edge of his coat. “It happens, sometimes,” he continued, his voice lower now. “Places do not crumble. They come undone, the way threads slip free from a weave. Old promises fray. Old bargains forget their strength.”  

A wind stirred from nowhere, moving dust that had no reason to move.  

“Some roads bend back upon themselves, again and again, until something takes shape between the turnings,” Bast said. He traced a loose, twisting pattern in the air with his fingers. “Something uncertain whether it should exist at all.”  

He paused, nostrils flaring, reading something in the air the rest of us couldn’t.  

Sim shivered. “That’s absurd.”  

Bast smiled. “Not if you know the stories.”  

I exchanged a glance with Wilem. Bast was being too careful. Even in the short time I’d known him, he’d carried the air of someone who had seen more than he cared to explain. But this was different. There was no performance in it.  

### * * *  

We found our perch along the old market district, an empty sprawl of forgotten stalls that had long since given up being useful.  

It gave us the vantage we needed, but not the certainty.  

The Low-House we suspected Trenati would use was just past where Renere’s streetlamps gave out. The street had no name. The lamps nearest the door had gone dark, though the ones on either side burned fine.  

Over the hours, men passed without looking. Footsteps that should have echoed didn’t. Some slowed as they approached the door as if they had forgotten why their feet had carried them there. This was not the silence of an empty room. It was the silence of a room that had been told to be quiet.  

Sim hunched forward on his elbows, frowning at something he couldn’t quite name. “That’s odd.”  

“What?” I murmured.  

“That man near the canopied stall,” Sim said. “The one lighting his pipe?”  

I followed his gaze. A dark-coated man with a heavy jaw leaned against a nearby stand, puffing at a twisted-stem pipe. Greenish smoke curled from his lips. He looked utterly at ease. Uninterested.  

Sim exhaled sharply. “I swear to Tehlu, I saw that man two streets away. By the theater. He leaned against a different wall, same pipe, smoking just like that.”  

“Maybe he moved faster than you did,” Wil murmured, though his eyes were already moving, subtly adjusting his line of sight.  

Sim wet his lips. “At the theater, he was smoking the end of a pipe. Here, it’s fully packed, just lit.”  

That left a thin silence.  

Then, something changed. The world drew breath. The hush broke. Light spilled beneath the door of the Low-House, and a figure stepped out, quick and certain, his coat flaring as he left the Whispering Quarter behind.  

At the next corner, just before his footsteps faded, he passed two women who were deep in conversation. Though something about them seemed slightly wrong. Their words came mid-sentence, as if they had been placed there already talking, the way a stage is dressed before the curtain lifts.  

One of them glanced in his direction and hesitated.  

“You’re back early,” she said, confused.  

The man gave a casual wave, smiling.  

“Gods above,” the other woman muttered. “I thought you’d already left town.”  

A slow, prickling silence hung between all of us.  

Even Sim had caught it. I watched the man’s back as he rounded the corner. No hesitation in his stride. No fumbling for direction. I have seen a thousand people walk offstage, and they all share the same half-second of uncertainty when the lights change and the world stops being the one they rehearsed. This man didn’t have it. He knew exactly where he’d been.  

Only the world itself had lost him.  

Wilem, who had been carefully tracking the men entering and not leaving, frowned suddenly.  

Then, a sharp edge in his voice, he whispered, “That’s not possible.”  

“What isn’t?” Sim asked sharply.  

Wilem didn’t look up. He wasn’t asking anymore. He was checking.  

He flipped back through his notes, fingers pressing into the page. Running the tally a second time. A third. His lips parted slightly, exhaling a slow, careful breath.  

“There were twelve,” he muttered, mostly to himself. “I know I counted twelve.”  

Sim and I exchanged a glance.  

“There were twelve,” I said cautiously.  

“Then why are there still twelve inside?” Wil muttered, flipping pages back and forth.  

“Numbers don’t lie,” Sim said, though he sounded like he wished they did.  

Bast, who had been restless beside me, went still. One hand rose, fingers spread. A sharp hiss through his teeth.  

I listened.  

Silence.  

That was wrong. The market should not be silent. Even this late, even in its quietest corners, there should be the scrape of boots on stone, the distant clang of dishes, the gentle ripple of conversation.  

But for a breath, there was nothing. As if the city had drawn a breath and held it.  

Then it returned. Murmurs braided back into the night. Somewhere, a laugh echoed off stone. But there had been a moment where Renere had forgotten to let itself exist.  

### * * *  

A figure in a clerk’s coat passed by, carrying a leather satchel. He paused by a lantern to adjust the clasp with fumbling fingers.  

I watched his hands without meaning to. Right up until his fingers touched the clasp.  

Then, more movement.  

Prince Trenati.  

His step was certain. Unhurried. Measured.  

I felt him fade while watching him move. Once he walked forward, it did not matter that he had walked before.  

I saw him glance toward a passing street vendor.  

The man nodded, a greeting offered on reflex to someone he would not remember seeing.  

He was still here. In some ways, at least.  

“We don’t belong here,” Bast murmured.  

I kept watching Trenati. “He does.”  

Bast laughed under his breath. There was no warmth behind it.  

“For now,” he said softly. “’Belonging’ is a debt this place will come back to collect.”  

Sim let out a slow breath. “Do people come back?”  

Bast’s fingers drummed against his trousers. The shrug he offered was empty. Unconvincing.  

I knew better than to stay, of course. I have always known better. It has never once made a difference.  

I stayed.  

Wil’s fingers tightened around his notebook. “I don’t like this,” he murmured, barely moving his lips. “We should reposition.”  

“Why?” Sim breathed.  

“Because we’re too still,” Wil said. “Four men. One table. No movement.” He glanced toward the Low-House. “We look like exactly what we are.”  

I exhaled.  

“Wait. Too late,” Wilem whispered sharply.  

I stiffened. Sim went rigid beside me.  

Wil wasn’t looking at the Low-House anymore. He was looking past it, toward the side street where a man had stopped mid-step. His eyes were locked directly onto us. A casual passerby wouldn’t stop like that.  

The heavy-jawed man with the pipe was the second. He leaned against a lamp post, pipe at his lips. But now I saw that the smoking was only a pretense.  

The third, the clerk, began to angle back toward us.  

The fourth, the street vendor.  

The weight of it landed. All at once.  

“They’re not watching him,” Sim whispered, barely breathing the words. “They’re watching for *us*. For anyone watching *him*.”  

Now we were the ones being watched.  

And with that thought came a worse one. We had been watched for some time. The heavy-jawed man had been trailing us since the theater. Perhaps longer. They hadn’t been waiting to spot us. They’d been waiting to see how much we’d already seen.  

Wil tensed beside me. “We move now.”  

We turned, but too late. The second man flicked his wrist twice, and the others reacted without hesitation.  

One moment, the alley was clear.  

The next, we weren’t alone.  

The first man stepped in behind us, cutting off the exit. The doorman peeled away from his post by the Low-House and crossed toward us.  

We were surrounded.
