# CHAPTER 44.

## THE HOLLOW CROWN.


For two days I did nothing but lie on a thin mat in the Tahl’s camp. I ate when they brought food. I drank when they brought water. I slept when the sun grew too hot to do anything else.  

It was not rest. It was something else. Something less.  

When I closed my eyes, I saw faces. Wil first, still and patient even in death, his blood dried to the color of old wine. Then Sim, looking at me with those soft eyes that had never held anything harder than worry for a friend. He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to. His silence said everything.  

Denna came differently. She walked through my dreams with her back always turned, always leaving through doors I couldn’t reach. I called her name and she would pause but never turn. I reached for her and found only empty air. She was smoke. She was wind. She was gone.  

Through it all, Auri’s plea wormed through my grief, eating small holes in the darkness. Live, she had said. One word was all. But that one word tethered me to the waking world when letting go would have been so much easier.  

On the third morning, Taeylia came to my mat. Her weathered face held the same kindness it had shown when she’d tried to save Denna, but now it carried something firmer too. She lowered herself to sit beside me with the careful movements of age, and when she spoke, her Aturan came slow and rusty, like a door that hadn’t opened in years.  

“You must go,” she said. The words weren’t cruel, but they were final. “We have done much. The desert has little to spare.” She paused then, her fingers moving as if she could pluck the right words from the air. When she spoke again, her Aturan came more careful. “Grief is hungry. It will eat more than we can give.”  

I understood. The Tahl had given me water when I was dying. They had given me shelter when I had nowhere else to turn. They had even given me time to pour my sorrow into their silence. But I was a stranger who had brought death to their door, and their kindness had boundaries. They had their own bellies to fill, their own water to guard. A broken man who did nothing but grieve was a weight they couldn’t carry.  

Taeylia’s hand touched my shoulder, gentle as falling sand. “Your woman is at peace,” she said, and I could hear how carefully she chose each word. “We sang her to the stars. It is done well.” She studied my face for a long moment, her dark eyes reading something written in the hollows beneath mine. When she spoke again, her voice carried a different weight. “But you are not done. The living must walk.”  

Another of the Tahl stepped forward then, a younger woman with sun-dark hands. She pressed warm bread into my palm and held out a waterskin, already full, the leather still damp from filling. No words passed between us. None were needed. Taeylia knelt in the sand and drew me a map with one weathered finger, tracing the path through the mountains while she murmured landmarks in careful Aturan mixed with the gestures her people used when words failed. But beneath all this kindness lay iron. I had to go. Today.  

I gathered what little I owned. My body moved through the motions while my mind stayed somewhere else, somewhere gray and quiet. The Tahl watched me leave from a careful distance. Taeylia stood at their head, her face unreadable as stone worn smooth by wind. No one waved. But as I passed the camp’s edge, I heard her voice one last time, so soft I might have imagined it.  

“Walk well, broken one. Walk until you are whole.”  

As evening fell and the stars began their slow opening above the desert, I walked west. Each step took effort. Not because I was tired, though I was. Not because I was weak, though I was that too. But because some part of me wanted to stop. To sit. To stay. To become one more piece of the desert, worn smooth by wind and sand until nothing remained.  

But Auri had told me to live. So I lived. I walked. One foot, then the other. Again and again. It wasn’t much of a life, but it was what I had.  

The stars came out, cold and distant. I spoke their names under my breath. It was something to do with my mouth besides scream. Something to do with my mind besides remember. The exercise felt hollow, but I did it anyway. Sometimes the motions of living are all we have.  

### * * *  

Renere was not the city I remembered.  

I arrived at the gates with my clothes in tatters, my feet bare and bleeding. The guards didn’t look at me. They looked through me. No one in Renere was looking at anyone, not really.  

The city wore a weary silence. Not the quiet of evening or snow, but the careful hush of people who had learned that words could be dangerous. Merchants whispered their trades and hurried away. Children played in alleys but watched the streets. Everyone moved with their heads down, the way you do when you have mouths to feed and no time for trouble.  

Then I saw the first sign.  

> Feyda.  

The name was painted in red across a wall, the letters tall as a man. I found it again on the next street, scrawled across a banker’s door. Then again on a tavern’s shutters. The dead king’s name bloomed across the city like a rash, spreading from wall to wall in crimson defiance.  

As I watched, two figures emerged from an alley’s mouth. One wore a mask and crouched on another’s shoulders, reaching up with a dripping brush to mark “Feyda” across a shop’s sign. They vanished before the patrol could round the corner, leaving only wet paint and questions behind.  

The Maer’s soldiers were everywhere and nowhere. They walked in pairs with lanterns held high, their white and blue livery clean as fresh snow against Renere’s gray stones. They stopped anyone who walked alone too long, but their questions rang hollow. These streets had already chosen their loyalty, and it wasn’t to the new king who wore a stolen crown.  

The Blind Beggar stood where I’d left it, wearing its shabbiness like comfortable clothes. The windows were boarded, the door marked with that same red paint. “Feyda.” Even here, rebellion had found purchase.  

I slipped around to the side where memory served me well. The window latch yielded to my good hand, and I climbed through into darkness that smelled of dust and abandoned hopes. Our room waited, patient as a held breath. The furniture stood exactly as we’d left it. The bed still bore the impression of bodies that would never return to fill those spaces.  

No message waited. No sign of passage. Bast had vanished as completely as smoke in wind.  

I climbed back through the window and dropped into the alley, my feet finding the ground with barely a whisper.  

“You’re losing your touch, Reshi.”  

The voice came from shadow, but I knew it before my eyes found its source. My shoulders dropped their tension. My ruined hand, which had risen in defense, fell back to my side.  

“Bast.” The name left me as a sigh.  

He stepped from darkness wearing his familiar grin, all sharp edges and mischief. In his hand, something gleamed. A compass. The needle trembled against its housing like a living thing.  

“I kept it,” he said, and for once his voice held no jest. “After everything went wrong. After they were gone. But look.” He held it toward me, and I saw the needle dancing, pointing straight at my heart. “The moment you entered the city, it woke. Like it was waiting.”  

“Wil’s compass.” The words scraped my throat raw.  

Bast nodded. “I kept it after everything went wrong.” His eyes found my ruined hand then, and his breath caught. “Reshi, your fingers.” The words came out strangled. He reached toward my hand but stopped when I pulled it away.  

“Gone.” I tucked my hand against my side, not ready for that conversation. “The compass needs to be destroyed, Bast. If anyone else finds it.” I stopped, seeing understanding dawn in his eyes.  

He held it out to me. “I had to be sure it was really you first. Where have you been? It’s been twelve days. I searched everywhere I could think of.” His voice carried an edge I rarely heard from him, something between anger and relief. “I even went looking for that girl of yours, thinking maybe you’d run off together. But she vanished the same night you did.”  

The words hit like cold water. Of course. Bast didn’t know. How could he?  

“Denna’s dead.” The words came out flat and final.  

Bast seemed to shrink into himself, shoulders dropping as if the words had added weight to them. “Reshi.” His voice came out soft, almost bruised. He started to reach toward me, then let his hand fall, understanding that some griefs don’t want touching.  

“We need to destroy the compass,” I said, taking it from his hands. The needle still danced, pointing at my heart with unwavering certainty. A liability I couldn’t afford. Not with fifty gold marks on my head.  

Bast watched me for a long moment, reading something in my face. Then he said quietly, “There’s an old furnace two streets over. Hot enough to melt the bindings.”  

I nodded, grateful he wasn’t pressing for details. Not yet. The story of what happened in the desert, of Denna’s last breath under the singing trees, would have to wait. Right now, I could barely carry the memory, let alone speak it aloud.  

I turned away from the weight of that, seeking safer ground. “The city looks ready to tear itself apart.”  

“After what happened at the tower, how could it not?” Bast shifted his weight, and I heard the leather of his boots whisper against stone. “After the King died, after Fascino fell, the Maer gathered what remained of Renere at the Citadel gates.”  

“Let me guess. He played the grieving ally?”  

“Oh, better than that.” Bast’s voice carried the kind of admiration one reserves for particularly clever predators. “He told them you did it. All of it. That you murdered the entire royal line in cold blood.”  

A bitter laugh escaped me. “Of course he did. How convenient for him. I appear from nowhere, kill everyone between him and the throne, then vanish into air.”  

“He had answers for the doubters too. Admitted you’d once served him, claimed complete ignorance of your plans. Then, for those still unconvinced, he went one step further.”  

“Which was?”  

“He brought out priests. Knelt before them in front of everyone. Proclaimed his repentance for not stopping you, swore he’d accepted Tehlu’s iron chains in penance.” Bast’s expression twisted with the particular disgust the Fae reserve for human religion. “Went on about justice in his heart and service to the divine. You know how your kind eat that up.”  

“So he crowned himself.”  

“Oh yes. Full ceremony, blessed oils, the works.” Bast’s grin returned, sharp as winter. “After they crowned him, his first decree concerned you and any who’d helped you. Said you’d all face the same justice as Wil and Sim already had.”  

The names hit me like physical blows. I thought of their families learning their sons had died as traitors. That Alveron would use their memory as a weapon made my hands curl into fists.  

“That’s when I got an idea,” Bast continued, his voice gentle now. “I took work carting bodies after the coup. Found them both. Found this.” He touched the compass again. “It was so still I almost threw it away. Then you got close, and it started moving like a living thing.”  

“Did you see to them?” The question came out small and ashamed.  

“I did what I could. They’re buried together, south of here. I don’t know all your manling customs, but I did my best.” He paused, then added quietly, “They deserved better than what they got.”  

I placed my good hand on his shoulder, feeling the solid warmth of him. “Thank you, Bast.”  

“That’s not all I learned, Reshi.” His grin returned, bright as a blade. “Auri lives.”  

The world stopped. The city’s noise faded to nothing. Even my heart seemed to pause between beats.  

“What?”  

“She’s alive, Reshi. Hidden, guarded, but breathing.” His eyes danced with something that might have been hope. “We’re not done yet.”
