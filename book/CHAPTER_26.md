# CHAPTER 26.

## STORIES WE TELL OURSELVES.


“STAPLES.”

I didn’t raise my voice.

I didn’t need to.

It passed through the morning air with the weight of a name long withheld. The street was full of the usual market din. Traders bellowed over bruised apples, boots struck stone, and pigeons rustled as they claimed the eaves. Yet my word threaded beneath it all. It was thin as a blade and cold as a bell’s first ring in winter. The name was not spoken louder than the noise, but truer.

He paused midstride. It was only a half-step, yet I saw hesitation ripple down his spine. His hand hovered near his belt, not resting on a weapon, but moving in that habitual way men have when they are bracing themselves. When they are remembering someone they wished they would forget.

He turned slowly. His eyes squinted through the alley’s hash of shadow and light, searching the shape of me like a man brushing dust off an old portrait he never meant to keep.

“By the Lady’s breath,” he muttered. Not amazement. Not relief. Just the tired weight of old surprise. “Kvothe.”

I stepped from the shadow and let the light find my face. My cloak hung deliberately loose, my hands bare at my sides.

“I wasn’t sure you’d still recognize me,” I said.

He did not approach. Still, his gaze sharpened, both cautious and appraising. “I recognize ghosts well enough. The real question is whether they leave footprints.”

“Only when the snow is fresh.”

That drew the shadow of a smile from him, though it did not reach his voice. He was not aged so much as polished down. The trim of grey at his brow hinted at it, and the quiet carving at the corners of his eyes spoke of it as well. He was the same man, only worn smoother by politics and by consequence.

“If Lady Meluan sees me on this street with you,” he said, his voice half warning and half lament.

“She won’t,” I said. “We both know her reach may be long, though her interest is brief. This stays here. It ends in the dust, the way a forgotten coin might. I do not need much. Only your time. Only this.”

I pulled back my cloak and extended my left hand. Resting there, smooth and ribbed with a pale, quiet gleam, was the bone ring. The Maer’s ring was never worn for vanity, but for memory alone. It was a promise I had never returned, though many had tried to unmake it.

“You still wear it,” he said, voice low.

“Some names don’t wash off,” I said. “No matter how far you’ve wandered.”

He didn’t speak immediately. Just looked. First at the ring, then at me. “You shouldn’t have come,” he said after a long pause. “Not here. Not after what was said. After what came down in Severen.”

“I didn’t come to replay that,” I said. “I came to do the thing I failed to do last time. I came to warn him.”

That stopped him. Not from stepping backward, but from stepping forward.

He looked away, toward the rooftops, toward the fountain beyond, toward anywhere but me. Something behind his eyes moved like dust in a shaft of light.

“She’s still tending the fire,” he said after a time. “Meluan. It has been years. He stopped answering council summons and kept to his quarters. She claims your song enchanted him and your charm made a fool of him.” He looked over at me. “And the court laughed. Not everyone joined in, but enough of them did.”

I said nothing.

“You left, and she pulled the rug from under him. The boy from the road with the wild stories? Turned liar. Turned betrayal. She convinced the old bloods they’d been duped by a stage magician. That he’d been made low by soft words and softer hands.”

“I’m not here to ask forgiveness,” I said. “I’ve brought something darker than regret.”

He narrowed his eyes.

“Then say it plain.”

I looked at him, letting the words form as slowly as they needed. “Old bloodlines waking up,” I said. “Songs written backward. Power hiding in stories. There are names trying to rewrite the world.”

For a long moment, the two of us stood unmoving. Like watchmen in a winter square.

At last, he reached beneath his coat. His hand came back with a small pouch, plain as river stone. The stitching was worn and patient. The drawstring pulled tight and sure, more careful than fine. He opened it slow, as if the moment mattered. From within, he drew a ring, silver dulled by years and the memory of touch. Old sigils lingered on its surface, soft as whispers, faded but not forgotten.

“If I give you this,” he said quietly, “I lose something clean.” He turned the object in his fingers. “But maybe that is what is needed these days. Silver tarnishes, it is true. Yet tarnish remembers the light.”

He pressed the ring into my palm.

“It’ll get you through the gate,” he said. “Don’t expect more than that. Name or no, you don’t belong in that court. Not anymore.”

“I’m not expecting warmth,” I said. “Just space to speak.”

He started patting his pockets. “I need to send a name with you. A note.” He squinted. “Damn, no pen.”

I was already slipping open my satchel. Quill. Ink. Paper. Laid out like old friends.

“You always travel like a scribe?” he muttered softly.

“Scholars carry books,” I murmured. “I carry reasons.”

He wrote efficiently, his handwriting crisp and deliberate, like a man who knew the cost of misunderstanding. When he passed me the sealed note, his fingers lingered just a moment longer than necessary.

“I remember,” he said softly.

“What I did?” I asked, though I already knew.

He shook his head. “Who you were.”

“And for you, is that memory bitter?”

“It’s memory,” he said. “That’s enough to get you past the guards. The rest? Well, the rest is the weather.”

He turned as if to leave, then paused, half-swallowed in the swirl of market haze.

“He kept your ring too,” Stapes said, without turning. “The Maer. Never spoke of it. Never wore it. But never melted it down, either.”

I folded both rings into the lining of my coat, bone and silver resting side by side. One cold with quiet promise, the other warm with remembered service.

“That’s more than I expected,” I said after him.

He glanced back, just once. “You never expected too much,” he said. “That was your trouble.”

A beat passed.

“And your strength.”

Then he was gone. Swallowed by the street. Like a story that had been told once, but whose ending no one remembered well enough to retell.

### * * *

The streets near the fountain had fallen quiet. Noise faded, except for the slow complaint of the grocer’s cart, rolling home beneath the fading light. I slipped through the back alleys, weaving past shadow and brick. Perhaps it was faster. Perhaps it only felt that way. Or perhaps, if I let myself be honest, it was only because I hoped those narrow lanes would keep me from crossing paths with Denna.

Still, it wasn’t enough.

“Leaving without saying goodbye?”

Her words were not loud, but they clung to the air the way a single note does when drawn from a harp. Unexpected. Tender. So carefully tuned that the silence which followed felt cruel.

I froze. She was standing in the slivered shade near the old stone bench, loose strands of hair catching the last amber light. I hadn’t seen her approach. I never did, not when it mattered.

“Denna,” I said, my voice drawing more from guilt than greeting. “I wasn’t.”

She stepped closer, arms wrapped tight across her chest. “You weren’t what? Standing me up? Disappearing again? Slipping off like a badly penned epilogue?”

“I didn’t want to complicate things.”

Her smile was thin, brittle at the edge. “Ah, so vanishing without a word is your way of simplifying life? Curious method, but I suppose for some it works.”

“It’s not like that,” I said quickly, feeling the shape of the truth resist my tongue. “I have to go to Severen.”

“Severen,” she repeated thoughtfully, as if tasting the name, not questioning it. “I see.”

Her eyes searched mine, far gentler than her words. “You know,” she said after a pause, “it just so happens I’ve been summoned there myself.”

That stopped me short. “You have?”

She nodded. A wrinkle of mischief, or perhaps misdirection, tugged at the corner of her mouth. “There is a noble in Severen, one of the old bloodlines. My patron asked me to look into their sigils and histories, all for the sake of authenticity. Apparently, the melancholy in my last sonnet needed a touch of genealogical depth.”

Her lips twitched, half-laugh, half-apology.

I tilted my head. “You’re writing songs about family trees now?”

“Only the tragic branches,” she replied. “The ones struck by lightning. They make the best verses.”

“Does your patron often make such peculiar requests?”

She looked past me, toward the cobbled street fading into twilight. “He’s a patron,” she said softly. “They all have their peculiarities.” Then she turned her gaze back to me, steady now. “But I don’t mind indulging him. Not when it aligns with my curiosity.”

“And what is it you’re curious about, exactly?”

“Old names,” she said. “Things buried in stone. Lines inherited but never spoken aloud.” She stopped, watching my face carefully. “Some names don’t want to be remembered. Some songs only make sense in reverse.”

“I thought you traveled where wind and whims took you,” I said lightly, trying to change the current of the moment.

“I do,” she said. “And it seems the wind’s taking me to Severen.” She brushed her cloak tighter around her. “So unless you’re planning to turn me away, I’d say we have a shared direction.”

I hesitated. “You’re sure?” I asked. “This isn’t just following shadows again?”

“Hardly,” she said with a smirk. “This time, I’m chasing names.”

She said it as if it were truth. A commission, a patron, and a sonnet’s whim all drawing her north. A noble house with a family tree longing for verse. And through it all, a straight back and a quirk of a smile.

But I knew.

Not with certainty, not the way I know a chord that rings true or the feel of perfect pitch under my fingers. It was a deeper sort of knowing, the quiet kind you keep tucked behind your ribs.

She lied.

Not out of malice, or play. She lied because truth would have admitted too much. And I let her have the lie. I’d rather a beautiful fiction spoken for my sake than an awkward silence born of honesty.

So I smiled. I nodded. I accepted the story she offered, as if I believed it.

Because if chasing me was simpler when wrapped in a pretext, who was I to take it away?

That’s what we did, after all. We gave each other stories when truths were too sharp to hold. For once, we were not chasing each other in circles. We were walking the same path.

### * * *

Dust settled on us in secret ways. It clung thick to the hems of my cloak and lingered deep behind Denna’s knees, where her mare moved easy, smoother than mine ever managed. Her horse, dappled gray with old Khershaen blood, carried her like a promise woven from song. My own mount plodded onward, stubborn as any dockworker and begrudging every mile.

We took more breaks than we needed. I told myself it was for the horses.

It was easier when we were moving.

At rest, our conversations fell into old habits. Half-lies dressed in cleverness. Truths slipped sideways into banter. She spoke of patrons, of cities half-remembered. Places where men mangled poetry and women practiced the art of leaving before they were left. Details blurred at the edges. They always did. I did not press her. She did not press me. Not unless I let my guard down and said too much. That was our rhythm. The silent bargain between us.

“So tell me,” Denna said as we stood beneath a split-beamed tree, our horses chewing with shared disinterest. “Why Severen? Really.”

I hesitated. Too long. “It’s complicated.”

“Oh, come now. You’re terrible at avoiding questions. ‘It’s complicated’ has all the shape of a lie and none of the poetry.”

I pulled in a breath. “There’s someone in trouble.”

She blinked. “A lover?”

“No,” I said, too quickly.

That earned me a smirk. “Said every guilty man ever.”

“It’s not like that. She’s a friend.” I saw Denna stiffen. The conversation was unraveling, everything slipping away in the worst possible way.

“She’s from the University,” I said, choosing my words with care. My voice faltered, heavy with implication. “You might know her now by another name. Princess Ariel.”

That earned a cocked eyebrow.

“And what did you know her as?”

I exhaled. “Auri. She used to live beneath stone and starlight. She belonged to the edges of things.”

“And you think she’s in danger?” Denna pressed.

“I know she’s in danger. Five ways to Felling, they are trapping her.” I said. This time I didn’t flinch from the weight of the words. “She is someone who doesn’t belong in the place she’s found herself. The wrong name’s been hung on her shoulders, and it’s pressing her down.”

Denna cocked her head. “Princesses hardly need rescuing.”

“They do,” I said quietly. “Sometimes most of all.”

She blinked at that, then laughed, brittle half-tones flaking from the edge of her voice.

“You make it sound like a tragedy wrapped in lace.”

“Don’t all tragedies wear something beautiful?”

She narrowed her eyes slightly, then looked out over the ridgeline, where the pine-dark world fell off into distance. “You speak like turning someone into a lady is a kind of violence.”

“For a girl who lived by moonlight and music and the taste of honeyed air?” I said, softer than I meant. “Yes. Now every moment she wears a mask.”

Denna lowered her gaze for a moment, brushing a bit of dried bark from her cloak. “Some of us learn to live behind masks,” she said softly.

“You forget, Kvothe,” she continued, “lace is armor just as much as steel. You think it’s cruelty, but for some, it’s safety. It’s a roof, a bed, hot meals.”

She let out a breath. “It’s more than I had, once.”

“I know,” I said. And I did. But I also understood that Auri’s true self would not survive long among the careful knives. A cage made of music still hums with bars.

A quiet stretched between us, coiling slow and strange. After a long moment, Denna glanced sidelong at me, trying for a smile.

“Well,” she said, her voice like a woman changing the song before you heard its final verse. “I suppose if you’re off to be a gallant rescuer, I’ll be a dutiful scholar. My patron’s request can’t wait forever.”

I looked at her, uncertain. “You said you were researching the sigils of old bloodlines?”

She nodded, too quickly. “The tragic ones. Family trees pruned by sharp things. Dead sisters. Lost sons. It’s a poem, I think.”

“Of course,” I said. “All the noblest lies are.”

“Funny thing,” she said. “I was meant to head this way weeks ago. But I waited. For weather. For words. Hard to say, really.”

She didn’t look at me when she said it. And I was grateful.

If she had, I might have said something foolish. Something tender. Something true.

And neither of us were ready for that.
