# CHAPTER 9.

## A FOOLISH BARGIN.


I FOUND MYSELF AT Devi’s door once more.

This time, I had no tidy reason. No excuse I could claim. Not to myself. Not to the sly whisper of my pride. There was nothing I could offer that would satisfy my better judgment.

Perhaps this was her intention. She scattered secrets, left clues about the Four-Plate Door behind her like breadcrumbs. She led me through the hollow places of my mind, certain I would poke and prod and dwell. Or perhaps it was something simpler, exhaustion, slow and stubborn as river silt.

I was tired. Tired of pacing my narrow room. Tired of gnawing at the bitter bone of Lorren’s injustice. In the end I stood before her door, spent and empty, lacking even the thinnest excuse.

When Devi opened the door, she barely glanced at me before stepping aside and letting me cross back into her world of peculiar contradictions. Cinnamon warmth clung to cold alchemical glass, and the fragrant hum of something half-forgotten simmered on her desk. Her hair was drawn into a loose knot, and her lips were just slightly crooked, like a blade half-sheathed.

“Kvothe,” she said, letting my name stretch and curl off her tongue. “Back so soon? People will start to talk if you keep this up.”

“Let them,” I said, trying to match her casual tone as I stepped further inside. But her knowing smile and the glint in her eye made me feel caught, as though she already knew I was here at her mercy.

“And?” she prompted, waving a hand languidly. “Did you find what you were looking for?”

“There’s more than you’re telling me,” I blurted, every ounce of control snapping under the weight of my frustration. “You know more about what Lorren’s hiding, and you’ve been holding back.”

Devi tilted her head, her smile cutting sharper. “Sweet Kvothe, that’s a bold accusation. And here I thought we were friends.”

“Friends don’t play games like this.”

“Oh, Kvothe, they absolutely do,” she said, leaning back against the edge of her desk like a knife balanced on its tip. “But friendship doesn’t come cheap. You want to know what Lorren is keeping locked away? Get me into the Archives. Then we’ll talk.”

“No,” I said, my voice firm and unflinching. “Not a chance.”

Devi arched a skeptical brow. “So sudden, so certain. Why not, darling boy? Surely there’s room enough for two clever, hungry minds in your hallowed stacks.”

“There are places you don’t belong, Devi. Some doors wouldn’t close so cleanly after you passed through them.”

Her expression didn’t falter, but her fingers drummed slowly against the edge of the desk. “I expected better of you, Kvothe. I really did. I thought you’d understand a simple bargain between civilized people.”

“We’re not even having this conversation,” I snapped, pacing a short, tight line. “I won’t risk it.”

“You owe me,” she said. Her voice cut through mine like a blade.

That stopped me cold.

We argued after that, the words rising sharp and reckless between us. I tried to wield reason like a shield, but Devi cut through it with precision. She was a professional trader of secrets and debts, and I was at best a stubborn apprentice.

By the end, I caved.

“Fine,” I said, the word almost burning on its way out. “But on my terms.”

Her lips twitched into a smile. “How startlingly reasonable of you. And what, pray tell, are your terms?”

“No action until we’ve settled on a solid plan. One we both agree on.”

Devi inclined her head, her fingers resuming their rhythmic tap. “Fair enough,” she said, her grin softening but never leaving her face. “Lucky for you, I’ve already given this some thought.”

From the pocket of her robe, she produced a small vial no larger than her thumb. The liquid inside caught the lamplight, deep red with a faint shimmer that pulsed like a heartbeat.

“This,” she said, holding it aloft, “is a little marvel I’ve been tinkering with. Tasteless, odorless, and precise. A few drops in Lorren’s wine, and he’ll fall into the kind of slumber that dreams are jealous of. More importantly, he’ll remember nothing when he wakes.”

“And while he’s unconscious?” I asked, though her intentions hung in the air like a blade above a neck.

“You borrow the keys,” she said, her tone light as if discussing the weather. “No fuss. No noise. Surgical."

“Surgical,” I repeated, the word bitter in my mouth. “I can think of other words for drugging one of the Masters.”

Her wicked smile curled as she replied, “You know, Lorren keeps the keys to the Four-Plate Door under his robe with little else. Curious place to tuck something so important, don’t you think?”

The room seemed to twist around her words. At first, I felt disbelief and told myself it was impossible. Lorren was far too genuine for something like that. My next thought was less certain.

“What are you saying?” I asked carefully, the words drawing tight like a string.

Devi’s smile stretched, slow and deliberate. “Nothing, darling. Just facts.” Her tone was breezy, but something dark and knowing simmered beneath it. “And let’s just say, I’m rather good at getting close to people who think they’re untouchable.”

The implication hung in the air like an unanswered question, daring me to pull at its threads. I couldn’t decide if I was unsettled by her knowledge or by how easily she wielded it.

“I still don’t like this,” I said finally.

“I’d be worried if you did,” Devi said, setting the vial carefully on the corner of her desk. Then, looking at me expectantly, she continued, “But unless you’ve got a better plan?”

I wanted to argue. Everything in me itched to push back. But I couldn’t. I didn’t have another plan, and I was desperate enough to ignore how the sand beneath my feet was already shifting.

“Fine,” I said finally. “But there’s one more condition. I insist on testing it first. On me.”

Devi’s sharp laughter filled the room, fading almost as quickly as it began. When she saw my face, her amusement curdled. “You have my assurances. It works.”

“That won’t do,” I said, my voice more certain than I felt. “If we’re doing this, it’s my skin at stake. If it doesn’t work exactly the way you promise, I need to know now.”

For once, her mask of confidence slipped. Her free hand curled tight at her side before releasing, and her eyes flicked to the vial.

“Fine,” she said after a long moment, the word clipped and cold as forged iron. “Come back in three days. I’ll have everything ready.”

The weight of her words pressed on the space between us. For a moment, neither of us moved. Then she dropped the vial into her pocket, extinguished the green-tinted lamp, and sent me back out into the biting night air.

Three days felt like three years.

The first day was unbearable, my thoughts circling endlessly. Vashet’s voice crept into my head, sharp and demanding.

> “Which path lies closer to the Lethani?”  
> “The one that endangers everyone?”  
> “Or the one that preserves what you hold dear?”  

By the second day, it wasn’t Vashet’s voice haunting me but Wil and Sim’s. They cornered me in the dim shade of the Courtyard, their words bouncing off my already fragile resolve.

“People are talking,” Sim said, always too loud. “You’ve been seeing Devi an awful lot lately, you know.”

Wil shot him a glare before turning to me. “This isn’t like you, Kvothe. Do you even know why they expelled her?”

“I heard it was dueling,” I said casually, though the words were thick on my tongue.

“Alchemical experimentation,” Wil said. “Dangerous experimentation. She swore revenge on the Masters after they caught her.”

“And now you’re working with her?” Sim asked, clearly concerned.

I brushed them off with words I couldn’t bring myself to believe.

### * * *

By the evening of the third day, my uncertainty had deepened. Doubt no longer sat quietly in the back of my mind. It had become a living thing, restless and sharp-toothed. It gnawed at me whenever my thoughts wandered near. It moved with me as I walked the winding edges of the Underthing. It waited beside me in the half-light while I sat with my lute across my lap, Auri close enough to touch.

The music I found there was thin and strained. The notes stumbled from my fingers, clumsy and half-remembered. They held none of the shape or easy certainty I found in better moments. Still, Auri listened as she always did. Knees hugged to her chest. Hair tumbling round her shoulders. Her face turned up, pale and patient, like a flower seeking warmth. Her eyes, though, stayed strange and unreadable. She said nothing of the music’s failings. She revealed nothing except in the careful silence that lingered softly between the notes.

“You’re tangled,” she said as the last note faded into the still air. Her voice was soft but certain, as if she could see the snarl of my thoughts laid bare before her.

I ran my fingers lightly over the strings, pretending to tune them. “Just restless,” I said with a thin smile that couldn’t quite find its footing.

Auri tilted her head the other way, her pale hair catching the faintest glimmer of light. “No,” she said simply, her voice the quiet certainty of a secret well kept. “Not restless.”

She unfolded herself with the fluid grace of something quick and wild. For a moment, she hesitated, balancing lightly on the balls of her feet. Then, as if some invisible cue had whispered to her, she stepped away into the shadows, her movements soundless, belonging entirely to the dark world beneath the University.

I stayed where I was for a long time, staring at the weathered stone where her feet had danced moments before. Auri didn’t ask any questions, but just being near her reminded me how much she trusted me. That trust was fragile and fleeting, as delicate as blown glass held in hands that gripped too tightly.

This was why I had to be careful. Why I had to be better. The weight of her unspoken faith, thin as it was, added an unbearable heft to the decisions winding around inside me.

But that night, as I stood and made my way back across the river, I buried those doubts beneath the all-too-familiar tug of my own desires.

### * * *

The closer I got to Devi’s, the more my thoughts twisted. The nervous rhythm of my steps matched the churning in my chest. And yet I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. The archives had loomed before me for so long, locked and unattainable, that the thought of missing this one chance outweighed every hesitation.

I knew I was moving too quickly and trusting too easily. I knew my plan was patched together with fraying threads. But greed has a knack for muting better instincts, and mine whispered sweet lies.

> “This will work.”  
> “You’ll figure it out.”  
> “Devi’s just a means to an end.”  

I knocked on Devi’s door with a resolve that cracked at the edges, but I refused to acknowledge the strain. She opened it quickly, her sharp smile already in place, her eyes alight with purpose.

"Come inside," she said, her satisfaction dripping from each word.

For a fleeting moment, I hesitated. My mind conjured Auri’s unguarded smile, her weightless laughter twirling through the dark. The delicate trust she placed in me to keep her world safe. Then my thoughts returned to the archives, to the answers just out of reach, and I swallowed my hesitation whole.

Devi stepped aside, and I walked in. Greed pressed me forward, and doubt trailed behind like a shadow I refused to see.
