# CHAPTER 9.

## THE GEOMETRY OF SECRETS.


I sat cross-legged on my narrow bed, a stub of charcoal in one hand and a sheaf of scrap paper spread across my knees. The compass lay beside me, its needle still and patient, pointing toward a book I could not reach.  

The problem was simple enough in principle. I had a direction. If I took a second reading from a different position, I would have two lines. Where they crossed, my book would be. Triangulation. Child’s play for anyone who had studied under Master Brandeur.  

But principle and practice are distant cousins at best.  

The next morning, I descended into the Stacks with my compass and fresh determination. Two levels down, I found a quiet alcove near the eastern wall, tucked between shelves of Aturan histories that no one had touched in years. The needle swung, steadied, and pointed. I sighted along its length toward a distant shelf and estimated the angle against the corridor’s run.  

Fifty-three degrees. Perhaps fifty-four. The needle was thin, my eye imperfect, and the margin between them was uncertainty.  

I paced off two hundred feet along the main corridor, counting each step. Then I took my second reading.  

The needle pointed true. Sixty-one degrees off the corridor. Maybe sixty-two.  

I sat down right there on the cold stone floor, heedless of the scrivs who might find me, and began to sketch. Two lines, two angles, one known distance between them. The mathematics were straightforward. Where the lines crossed, my book would be waiting.  

The lines crossed behind the Four-Plate Door.  

Not far behind it. Perhaps ten or fifteen feet, if my angles were accurate. This confirmed what I had discovered the day before, when I had followed the compass needle through the twisting corridors until it led me to that grey stone face. The book was there, just beyond the threshold, waiting in whatever space lay hidden from the world. I imagined it sitting on a shelf or a table, freshly processed, my blood drying slowly between its pages.  

Close enough to tantalize. Far enough to drive me mad.  

I spent three more days in the deeper reaches of the Stacks, taking readings from every angle I could manage. The results were consistent, if imprecise. My book was behind the door. It was roughly ten to twenty feet beyond the threshold, somewhere in a room I could not enter.  

I recorded everything in a small notebook: angles, distances, positions, the orientation of corridors relative to one another. Each reading was another thread in the web I was slowly weaving. The acute angles frustrated me, since small errors in measurement translated to large uncertainties in position. But the overall picture was clear enough.  

My book was there. Just beyond the door. Waiting.  

The next step was obvious. More readings from different positions would narrow my uncertainty. And if I took readings from different floors, I could triangulate in three dimensions, pinning down not just the horizontal location but the height as well.  

I climbed the stairs toward the level above, already planning my approach.  

### * * *  

Over the following span, I took readings everywhere. In the administrative sections on the sub-one level where students rarely ventured. On the main floor, with its high ceilings and reading tables. Down in sub-three, where the corridors narrowed and the air grew cold and still. I mapped the vertical tilt of my compass at each level, noted the horizontal bearing to the last degree I could estimate, and recorded everything in notebooks that grew fat with figures.  

And nothing made sense.  

A knock came at my door just as I was beginning my ninth attempt at reconciling the readings from sub-two with those from the main floor.  

“Kvothe,” came Wil’s voice, patient but firm. “You’re late.”  

I didn’t look up from my calculations. “For what?”  

“Corners,” Simmon said from the doorway. “We’ve been waiting downstairs for the better part of an hour.”  

“I can’t. I need to finish this.”  

“I’ve barely seen you lately except for classes,” Sim said, stepping into the room. “Fela’s starting to think you’ve died.”  

“I’m fine,” I said, gesturing helplessly at the papers scattered across every surface. “I’m close. Just a little more time.”  

“Close to what?” Wil had moved to stand beside Sim, his dark Cealdish eyes scanning the figures and diagrams.  

I pulled out my clearest diagram showing all of the readings overlaid on a rough map of the Archives.  

Wil studied it for a long moment. “I don’t see the problem,” he said. “Four locations. Four objects.”  

Four objects. My blood, divided and scattered. Each one a weapon waiting to be found. I gripped the edge of my desk, my knuckles going white.  

“Kvothe?” Sim’s voice seemed distant. “You’ve gone pale.”  

“Breathe,” Wil said, his hand steady on my shoulder.  

I breathed. In. Out. The room steadied, though my hands still shook.  

Sim and Wil shared a look.  

“Whatever this is,” Sim said carefully, “it’s important. And you’re in over your head.”  

I wanted to deny it. But my white-knuckled grip on the desk said otherwise.  

“You’re good with numbers, Kvothe,” Sim continued. “But you’re not the best.” He paused. “I know what he did. But sometimes the best is what you need.”  

The suggestion hung in the air. Brandeur. The man who had helped kill Herma. But I looked down at my diagram, and knew I had no other choice.  

“Alright,” I said finally. “Tomorrow. I’ll go tomorrow.”  

“Good.” Sim’s shoulders relaxed slightly. “Now will you please come downstairs?”  

“One more night?” I asked. “I need to organize this first. If I’m going to Brandeur, I need to present it properly.”  

They left, and I sat alone with my diagrams.  

### * * *  

The next morning, I stood outside Master Brandeur’s office for a long moment with my hand raised before I knocked.  

“Enter,” came his voice through the door.  

I took a breath and pushed through.  

The office was buried in papers, weighted down with instruments, and smelled of chalk dust. The air was stale too, as if his door rarely opened. Brandeur was alone. Completely alone. No students waiting for consultations, no colleagues stopping by to discuss research. Just a portly, balding man sitting behind a desk piled with work that no one would ever read.  

I had played a part in that. A small part, perhaps, but a part nonetheless. And now I needed his help.  

“Kvothe.” He said as I entered. Surprise, then relief, crossed his face. “I don’t remember summoning you.”  

“You didn’t, Master Brandeur.” I kept my voice neutral, trying to ignore the tightness in my chest. “I came hoping you might help me with a problem.”  

“A problem.” He leaned back in his chair, which creaked beneath him. His eyes were sharp as ever, but there was a wariness in them now that I had not seen before. “What sort of problem brings a Re’lar to my door uninvited?”  

“A geometric one.” I produced the papers I had prepared the night before. My angles and distances stripped of all context, reduced to pure abstraction. No mention of compasses or blood or doors or buildings. Just shapes and numbers. “I’ve been trying to locate a point using angular measurements from multiple positions. But my readings don’t agree, and I can’t determine whether the inconsistency is error or something else.”  

Brandeur’s eyebrows rose slightly. He reached for the papers, and I let him take them. For a long moment, he said nothing. His eyes moved across my notations, my diagrams, my crossed-out attempts. I watched for dismissal, for refusal, for the cost of what I had done to him to reflect in his face.  

Instead, his shoulders unknotted. His breathing eased. The wariness in his eyes gave way to the hunger of someone who had been starving for work that mattered.  

“What do these groupings represent? You’ve labeled them one through four.”  

“Different observation platforms,” I said, which was true enough. “At different elevations.”  

“And the readings within each level are consistent, but the levels disagree with each other?”  

“Yes. I can’t figure out why.”  

Brandeur made a small sound, something between a grunt and acknowledgment. He pulled a fresh sheet of paper toward himself and began to work.  

I waited.  

Minutes passed. Brandeur filled one sheet with calculations, then another. He cross-referenced my numbers, drew diagrams, scratched out figures and rewrote them. His face had lost its guarded quality entirely now. He looked like a different man. Engaged. Animated. Alive in a way I had never seen during admissions or faculty meetings.  

“Interesting,” he murmured, half to himself. “Very interesting.”  

“What do you see?”  

He held up one finger, asking for patience. He worked for several more minutes, filling a third sheet with figures. Then he set down his pen. “You have two problems,” he said. “Not one. Two distinct anomalies, and you’ve been treating them as a single error.”  

“Two problems?”  

He tapped the papers I had sorted by floor. “First, your readings from your primary observation level. This one.” He indicated my sub-two measurements. “These readings cluster into two distinct groups. Watch.”  

He drew a diagram, plotting my angles as lines radiating from their observation points. “Your early readings intersect here.” He marked a point. “Your later readings intersect here.” He marked another point. “The gap between these clusters is too large to explain by measurement uncertainty alone.”  

“How can you be sure?”  

“Statistics.” He wrote a formula I did not recognize. “Given your stated precision and the number of observations in each cluster, I can calculate the probability that both clusters represent the same true location. That probability is very small. Less than one in a thousand. It just doesn’t look so distinct on the paper because there was also a substantial vertical adjustment.”  

“So it moved,” I said slowly.  

“Yes.” Brandeur shuffled through the papers again, his enthusiasm undimmed. “The second problem is more interesting. Look at your data from each level separately.”  

He spread out four sheets, each containing one level’s worth of measurements. “Level one. The readings cluster tightly here.” He marked a point. “Level two. Tight cluster here, or rather, two clusters, as we discussed. Level three, tight cluster here. Level four, here.”  

I looked at the four points. They were nowhere near each other.  

“If your target is stationary, or even if it moved once, as we’ve established, these four points should coincide. They don’t. Each level gives you a completely different answer.” Brandeur pulled out a fresh sheet and began sketching rapidly. “But watch what happens when I plot the vertical position.”  

He drew a simple graph, elevation on one axis, observation level on the other. Four points appeared, then he drew a horizontal line through them. “All four levels agree perfectly on the elevation. Your target is at the exact same height, regardless of which floor you measured from.”  

I stared at the line and felt the relief. A single object.  

“According to statistics,” Brandeur continued, “if these were truly four different objects scattered across space, the probability they would all share the exact same elevation is vanishingly small. This confirms what the movement data already suggested. You’re measuring a single object. But now we come to the interesting part.” He returned to his diagram of the four horizontal positions. “Look at the disagreement here. If this were random error, the four points would scatter in random directions. But they don’t.”  

He drew lines connecting the four points. They formed a rough spiral pattern, each point rotated relative to the last.  

“The disagreement is systematic,” he said. “Each level’s answer is rotated relative to the others. As if.”  

He trailed off, waiting for me.  

I stared at the spiral pattern. Rotated. Each level rotated relative to the others. And suddenly, I understood.  

“The coordinate systems,” I said, the words coming fast as the pieces clicked into place. “What if the reference frame at level one is rotated relative to level two? And level two is rotated relative to level three? That would explain exactly this pattern.”  

Brandeur looked up at me, and I saw genuine pleasure in his eyes. The satisfaction of a teacher whose student had just made a leap. “Precisely. You’ve been assuming your coordinate systems align. That ’north’ at level one points the same direction as ’north’ at level two. But your data suggests otherwise. Each level seems to have its own orientation, rotated relative to the others.”  

“But why would reference frames rotate between levels?”  

“I have no idea.” Brandeur shrugged. “I don’t know what you’re measuring or where you’re measuring it. I only know what the numbers say. And the numbers say your coordinate systems don’t align.” He gathered my papers into a neat stack and held them out to me. “Whatever space you’re working in, it’s not oriented the way you think it is. Fix your coordinate transformations, and your data will converge.”  

I took the papers, my mind racing. Rotating coordinate systems. Reference frames that shifted between levels. What could possibly cause that?  

“How do I fix it?” I asked. “If I don’t know how much each level is rotated?”  

“Measure it.” Brandeur’s tone was practical now, a teacher assigning homework. “Find some way to determine the angular offset between your reference frames. Then transform all your observations into a single unified system. The mathematics is straightforward. I can show you the rotation formulas if you need them.”  

He did, spending another quarter hour walking me through the process of transforming coordinates from one rotated frame to another. He was a good teacher. Genuinely good. Patient and clear, building each concept on the foundation of the last. Nothing like the silent antagonist I had imagined from years of watching him vote against me at Hemme’s side.  

I wondered, not for the first time, how much of that had been his choice. Hemme had a talent for finding people’s weaknesses and pressing on them. Brandeur was not a man who made friends easily. I could see that in the relief that had filled his face when I walked through his door. If Hemme had been one of the only people to show him kindness, to include him, to make him feel like he belonged.  

It would not excuse what had happened. But it might explain it.  

“Thank you,” I said, gathering my papers. “This has been more helpful than I expected.”  

Brandeur nodded, and I saw what might have been gratitude in his eyes. “It’s a fascinating problem,” he said.  

### * * *  

I did not return to the Archives immediately.  

Instead, I walked. Through Hollows and across the courtyard. Past the Artificery with its ever-present smell of molten metal. Along the river, where the wind came cold off the water and cleared the fog from my mind.  

Brandeur’s words circled through my thoughts like crows around a carcass. *Your coordinate systems don’t align. Each level seems to have its own orientation, rotated relative to the others.*  

How could that be possible? The Archives was a building. Buildings had floors. Floors were stacked atop one another, aligned by walls and columns and the simple necessity of structural support. You could not rotate a floor without rotating everything above it. The idea was architectural nonsense.  

And yet my data said otherwise.  

By the time I reached the Archives, the sun was setting. I stood at the entrance for a long moment, looking up at the grey stone face of the building. It looked solid. Ordinary. A building like any other, with floors that stacked sensibly atop one another.  

But I had learned to distrust appearances.  

I descended to the main floor and found a corridor that ran clearly east-west, using the great doors as my reference. I fixed the direction in my mind, feeling it settle into my bones the way a musician fixes a pitch before beginning to play. Then I made my way to the stairwell that led down to sub-one.  

The stairs spiraled. I had walked them a hundred times before, never thinking to count the turns. Now I counted. Quarter-turn. Half-turn. Three-quarters. Full rotation. Another quarter before the stairs opened onto sub-one.  

I stepped out into the corridor and stopped.  

The passage ran perpendicular to where I had expected it to run. I turned to face what should have been east, the direction I had fixed so carefully in my mind, and found myself looking at a wall.  

I had descended one level, and the world had rotated around me.  

For a moment, I simply stood there, feeling the wrongness of it. I had been so certain of my internal compass, so confident in my sense of direction. But the stairs had turned me without my noticing. A quarter-turn here, a half-turn there, adding up to something more than a full rotation by the time I emerged.  

I walked the corridors of sub-one until I found the stairwell to sub-two. Again I counted the turns as I descended. More this time. The stairwell was longer, more convoluted, switching back on itself in ways that seemed almost deliberately confusing. When I emerged onto sub-two, I stopped and faced the direction I had come from.  

It was not the direction I expected.  

I continued to sub-three, counting, measuring, trying to build a map in my head of how each floor related to the others. It was difficult. The stairs did not merely spiral; they curved in ways that divorced each level from the one above. By the time I reached sub-three, my mental compass was spinning freely, unable to find true north.  

I stood in the corridor outside Puppet’s room and thought about what Brandeur had said. *Your coordinate systems don’t align.*  

Puppet had lived on sub-three for years. He claimed his room was directly beneath the Four-Plate Door, two levels above. He spoke of listening for sounds through the stone, of pressing his ear to the ceiling and imagining what secrets might be kept just overhead.  

But if the floors rotated...  

I pictured it in my mind. Sub-one, turned on its axis relative to the main floor. Sub-two, turned again relative to sub-one. Sub-three, turned once more. Each level connected to the next by a single stairwell, but that connection was a pivot point, not an anchor. The floors did not stack like plates in a cupboard. They spiraled like a nautilus shell, each chamber extending in a different direction from the one above.  

Puppet was not beneath the Four-Plate Door. He was not even close. He had been listening for secrets through a ceiling that was nowhere near the room he sought, and he had never known because no one thought to question the obvious assumption that floors sat squarely atop one another.  

I climbed back to the main floor, my legs aching but my mind sharp with discovery. The world had rotated around me four times on the way down, and now it rotated four times again on the way up. When I emerged into Tomes, I faced the great doors and confirmed that east was east again.  

The stairs had carried me in a full circle. Or rather, four partial circles, each one turning the world a different amount, so that the cumulative effect was to return me to my starting orientation while carrying me through floors that extended in completely different directions.  

It was brilliant. It was devious. It was a lock built into the bones of the building itself, a maze that confused not through dead ends and false passages but through the simple rotation of space.  

I returned to my room and pulled out my notebooks. With fresh eyes and fresh mathematics, I examined my readings from each floor. Not as a single combined data set, but as four separate puzzles that needed to be rotated into alignment before they could be compared.  

The work took hours. I had to estimate the angle of rotation between each level based on my stairwell observations. The main floor to sub-one: roughly forty-five degrees clockwise. Sub-one to sub-two: another ninety degrees. Sub-two to sub-three: perhaps sixty degrees counter-clockwise. Each estimate was rough, but Brandeur had given me the tools to refine them through iteration, adjusting the rotation angles until my data clusters converged.  

By midnight, my sub-two readings resolved into two distinct points: the book’s original location near the door, and its current location after being moved. By the small hours of the morning, my readings from all four floors began to agree with each other, their clusters overlapping when viewed through the lens of my corrected coordinate system.  

And when I finished, I had a location.  

The book was not behind the Four-Plate Door. Not anymore. It had been moved deeper, carried through passages I had never seen, shelved in a place that should have been impossible to reach.  

Thirty feet north of the Archives’ exterior wall. At an elevation just below ground level. High, relative to sub-two, but low relative to the surface.  

I pulled out the rough map I had made of the University grounds and traced a line from my position in the Archives, through the Four-Plate Door, and out into the hill beyond. The line did not stop at the building’s foundation. It continued, following the twisted orientation of sub-two, reaching toward a different building entirely.  

It ended beneath Mains.  

I sat back and stared at my diagram. The Four-Plate Door was on sub-two, deep underground. But due to the rotated geometry of the Archives, sub-two extended not directly beneath the building but outward, into the hill. The door’s corridor reached toward Mains like a root reaching toward water.  

And the room beyond the door, the hidden chamber where my book now rested, was not in the Archives at all. It was beneath the oldest building on campus, accessed through a passage that no one would ever find if they did not know the secret of the spiraling floors.  

Someone had built this deliberately. Someone had designed the Archives to confuse, to disorient, to hide the connection between the Stacks and whatever lay beneath Mains. The rotating floors were not an accident of ancient architecture. They were a lock, a maze, a misdirection built in stone.  

And Puppet, poor Puppet, had spent years listening for secrets through a ceiling that was nowhere near the room he sought. The geometry of the Archives had fooled him as thoroughly as it had fooled me.  

But I had found the key. I had measured the rotation. I had transformed my coordinates and followed the thread through the maze.  

My book was on a high shelf, near ground level, in a vertical space that climbed up through the hill toward the surface. Someone had carried it there, through the Four-Plate Door or through some other entrance, and shelved it among secrets that the University had kept hidden for centuries.  

I did not yet know how to reach it. But I knew where it was.  

And that was more than anyone had expected me to learn.  

### * * *  

The next morning, I walked to Mains with fresh eyes.  

I had passed through its halls a thousand times on my way to classes, to meals, to the Masters’ offices where I had argued my case before admissions and defended my tuition before unsympathetic faces. I knew Mains the way a fish knows water: intimately, thoughtlessly, without ever stopping to consider its shape.  

Now I tried to see it whole, and I could not.  

The building sprawled across the hillside like a stone beast that had collapsed mid-stride. Wings jutted at odd angles. Towers rose and fell with no apparent logic. Sections that should have connected did not; sections that should have been separate shared walls in ways that defied easy mapping. I walked its perimeter for an hour and came away with a sketch that looked like the work of a madman.  

The interior was worse.  

I spent three days trying to survey the northwest quarter, where my calculations suggested the hidden room should lie. But the corridors twisted back on themselves, interrupted by stairs that climbed half a level or descended into basements that connected to other basements that led to dead ends or locked doors or rooms that no one seemed to use for anything. I found storage chambers filled with broken furniture. I found a chapel that had been converted to a granary and then apparently abandoned. I found a staircase that spiraled down into darkness and ended at a wall of mortared stone that looked newer than the steps it blocked.  

That wall gave me pause. The mortar was old, decades at least, perhaps longer. But the stone blocks were fitted with a precision that spoke of deliberate construction. Someone had sealed this passage. Someone had decided that wherever those stairs led was no longer meant to be reached.  

Or perhaps they had decided it should only be reached from elsewhere.  

I marked the location in my notebook and kept searching.  

Everywhere I looked, Mains revealed the scars of its long history. Walls had been added and removed. Floors had been raised and lowered. Rooms had been divided, combined, sealed, forgotten, rediscovered, and sealed again. The building was not architecture; it was archaeology, layer upon layer of institutional decision compressed into stone.  

And somewhere in that mess, beneath floors I could not access and behind walls I could not see through, lay the room where my book now rested.  

I tried to triangulate from inside Mains as I had from inside the Archives, but the compass readings were nearly useless. The needle still pointed toward my book, but I could not establish clean baselines, could not pace off consistent distances, could not find positions from which to sight that were not blocked by walls or stairs or the accumulated debris of centuries. The building defeated me at every turn, not through malice but through sheer chaotic accretion.  

By the end of the third day, I had learned almost nothing new about the room’s precise location. But I had learned something else, something perhaps more important.  

The hidden room was old. Older than the Archives. Part of Mains’ original construction, perhaps, or something even more ancient that Mains had been built around. The Four-Plate Door was not the room’s first entrance. It was a later addition, a passage carved through the hill to connect the twisted depths of the Archives to a space that already existed.  

Someone, long ago, had decided that this room needed a second way in. A hidden way. A way that only the keepers of the Archives would know.  

And more recently, within the last span, someone had used that way to shelve my book.  

The question was no longer just what lay behind the door. The question was who had access, and how, and why.  

### * * *  

I could not map what lay beyond the Four-Plate Door. I could not enter it, could not see through it, could not learn its secrets through geometry alone. But I could watch.  

I could wait.  

The idea came to me slowly, the way good ideas often do. Not in a flash of inspiration but in a gradual accumulation of smaller thoughts. The door was in a corridor. Corridors could be observed. If I watched long enough, I might see something. Someone entering. Someone leaving. Some hint of what lay beyond that grey stone face.  

The problem was concealment. The corridor leading to the Four-Plate Door was bare of furniture, empty of alcoves, stripped of any convenient hiding place. A student loitering there would be noticed, questioned, remembered. I needed to be invisible.  

I chose a shelf in a nearby passage, one that faced toward the door’s corridor but far enough removed to avoid suspicion. Over two nights of careful work, I constructed a false front: a shallow frame holding book spines and just enough pages to give the illusion of depth. The books I borrowed from surrounding shelves, volumes so dusty and forgotten that no one would notice their absence.  

Behind the false front was a space just large enough for a man to lie on his side, if that man did not mind cramped quarters and the smell of old leather.  

I kept my first vigil on a Felling night, when the Archives were nearly empty and the scrivs moved through their rounds with the bored efficiency of familiar routine. I slipped behind my false front an hour before midnight, settling onto the hard shelf with my cloak bundled beneath my head. Through a gap between two book spines, I could see the corridor leading to the Four-Plate Door.  

Nothing happened.  

I watched for four hours, barely breathing, shifting only when my limbs threatened to cramp beyond endurance. The sympathy lamp at the corridor’s end flickered its pale light. Dust motes drifted. The door sat in its frame, grey and silent and utterly still.  

The second night was the same. And the third. And the fourth.  

I knew the room was accessed. My book had been moved and shelved, proof that someone went in and out. But perhaps they did not use the Four-Plate Door. Perhaps there was another entrance somewhere in the labyrinth of Mains, a way in that did not require navigating the twisted stairs of the Archives at all.  

On the fifth night, Lorren came.  

I heard him before I saw him: soft footsteps, too deliberate for a scriv, too measured for a student. Then his shadow fell across the corridor’s entrance, and my breath caught in my throat.  

He moved like a man approaching something sacred. His hands were empty. No lamp, no ring of keys. His face, what I could see of it in the dim light, was composed into an expression I had never seen him wear. Not cold. Not distant. Something else. Something almost like reverence.  

He stopped before the door and stood there for a long moment, head slightly bowed, as if listening to something I could not hear. Then he raised one hand and pressed his palm flat against the stone, just below the carved word VALARITAS.  

I waited for him to produce a key. To speak a word of command. To do something that would make the door swing open on ancient hinges.  

He did none of these things.  

He simply stood there, palm against stone, head bowed, for what might have been a minute or might have been an hour. I could not see his lips move. I could not hear any sound except the faint hum of the sympathy lamp and the distant settling of old books. The door remained closed. The silence remained absolute.  

Then Lorren lowered his hand, turned, and walked away. His footsteps faded into the deeper Stacks, and I was alone with the door and the dark and the questions that multiplied like shadows.  

He had not entered. He had not even tried. He had simply stood there, touching the door, communing with it in some way I could not understand.  

But someone had entered recently. Someone had shelved my book. If not Lorren through this door, then who? And through what entrance?  

I lay in my hiding place until dawn, watching the door that did not open, and understood for the first time that the Four-Plate Door might not be the way in at all. Perhaps it was something else entirely. A ritual site. A memorial. A reminder of something that the Masters still honored even if they no longer used.  

The room was accessed. But not through this door.  

Which meant there was another way.  

Somewhere in Mains. Somewhere in that labyrinth of sealed passages and mortared walls. An entrance that predated the Archives, an entrance that someone still used, an entrance I had not found.  

Yet.
