# CHAPTER 9.

## THE GEOMETRY OF SECRETS.


I sat cross-legged on my narrow bed, a stub of charcoal in one hand and a sheaf of scrap paper spread across my knees. The compass lay beside me, its needle still and patient, pointing toward a book I could not reach.  

The problem was simple enough in principle. I had a direction. If I took a second reading from a different position, I would have two lines. Where they crossed, my book would be. Triangulation. Child’s play for anyone who had studied under Master Brandeur.  

But principle and practice are distant cousins at best.  

The next morning, I descended into the Stacks with my compass and fresh determination. Two levels down, I found a quiet alcove near the eastern wall, tucked between shelves of Aturan histories that no one had touched in years. The needle swung, steadied, and pointed. I sighted along its length toward a distant shelf and estimated the angle against the corridor’s run.  

Fifty-three degrees. Perhaps fifty-four. The needle was thin, my eye imperfect, and the margin between them was uncertainty.  

I paced off two hundred feet along the main corridor, counting each step. Then I took my second reading.  

The needle pointed true. Sixty-one degrees off the corridor. Maybe sixty-two.  

I sat down right there on the cold stone floor, heedless of the scrivs who might find me, and began to sketch. Two lines, two angles, one known distance between them. The mathematics were straightforward. Where the lines crossed, my book would be waiting.  

The lines crossed behind the Four-Plate Door.  

Not far behind it. Perhaps ten or fifteen feet, if my angles were accurate. This confirmed what I had discovered the day before, when I had followed the compass needle through the twisting corridors until it led me to that grey stone face. Beyond it, the book waited in whatever space lay hidden from the world. I imagined it sitting on a shelf or a table, freshly processed, my blood drying slowly between its pages.  

Close enough to tantalize. Far enough to drive me mad.  

I spent three more days in the deeper reaches of the Stacks, taking readings from every angle I could manage. The results were consistent, if imprecise. My book was behind the door, roughly ten to twenty feet past it, somewhere in a room I could not enter.  

I recorded everything in a small notebook: angles, distances, positions, the orientation of corridors relative to one another. Each reading was another thread in the web I was slowly weaving. The acute angles frustrated me, since small errors in measurement translated to large uncertainties in position. But the overall picture was clear enough.  

The next step was obvious. More readings from different positions would narrow my uncertainty. And if I took readings from different floors, I could triangulate in three dimensions, pinning down not just the horizontal location but the height as well.  

I climbed the stairs toward the level above, already planning my approach.  

### * * *  

Over the following span, I took readings everywhere. In the administrative sections on the sub-one level where students rarely ventured. On the main floor, with its high ceilings and reading tables. Down in sub-three, where the corridors narrowed and the air grew cold and still. I mapped the vertical tilt of my compass at each level, noted the horizontal bearing to the last degree I could estimate, and recorded everything in notebooks that grew fat with figures.  

And nothing made sense.  

A knock came at my door just as I was beginning my ninth attempt at reconciling the readings from sub-two with those from the main floor.  

“Kvothe,” came Wil’s voice, patient but firm. “You’re late.”  

I didn’t look up from my calculations. “For what?”  

“Corners,” Simmon said from the doorway. “We’ve been waiting downstairs for the better part of an hour.”  

“I can’t. I need to finish this.”  

“I’ve barely seen you lately except for classes,” Sim said, stepping into the room. “Fela’s starting to think you’ve died.”  

“I’m fine,” I said, gesturing helplessly at the papers scattered across every surface. “I’m close. Just a little more time.”  

“Close to what?” Wil had moved to stand beside Sim, his dark Cealdish eyes scanning the figures and diagrams.  

I pulled out my clearest diagram showing all of the readings overlaid on a rough map of the Archives.  

Wil studied it for a long moment. “I don’t see the problem,” he said. “Four locations. Four objects.”  

Four objects. My blood, divided and scattered. Each one a weapon waiting to be found. I gripped the edge of my desk, my knuckles going white.  

“Kvothe?” Sim’s voice seemed distant. “You’ve gone pale.”  

“Breathe,” Wil said, his hand steady on my shoulder.  

I breathed. In. Out. The room steadied, though my hands still shook.  

Sim and Wil shared a look.  

“Whatever this is,” Sim said carefully, “it’s important. And you’re in over your head.”  

I wanted to deny it. But my white-knuckled grip on the desk said otherwise.  

“You’re good with numbers, Kvothe,” Sim continued. “But you’re not the best.” He paused. “I know what he did. But sometimes the best is what you need.”  

The suggestion hung in the air. Brandeur. The man who had helped kill Herma. But I looked down at my diagram, and knew I had no other choice.  

“Alright,” I said finally. “Tomorrow. I’ll go tomorrow.”  

“Good.” Sim’s shoulders relaxed slightly. “Now will you please come downstairs?”  

“One more night?” I asked. “I need to organize this first. If I’m going to Brandeur, I need to present it properly.”  

They left, and I sat alone with my diagrams.  

### * * *  

The next morning, I stood outside Master Brandeur’s office for a long moment with my hand raised before I knocked.  

“Enter,” came his voice through the door.  

I took a breath and pushed through.  

The office was buried in papers, weighted down with instruments, and smelled of chalk dust. The air was stale, as if his door rarely opened. Brandeur was alone. Completely alone. No students waiting for consultations, no colleagues stopping by to discuss research. Just a portly, balding man sitting behind a desk piled with work that no one would ever read.  

I had played a part in that. A small part, perhaps, but a part nonetheless. And now I needed his help.  

“Kvothe.” He looked up. Surprise, then relief, crossed his face. “I don’t remember summoning you.”  

“You didn’t, Master Brandeur.” I kept my voice neutral, trying to ignore the tightness in my chest. “I came hoping you might help me with a problem.”  

“A problem.” He leaned back in a chair that creaked beneath him. His eyes were sharp as ever, but there was a wariness in them now that I had not seen before. “What sort of problem brings a Re’lar to my door uninvited?”  

“A geometric one.” I produced the papers I had prepared the night before. My angles and distances stripped of all context, just shapes and numbers. “I’ve been trying to locate a point using angular measurements from multiple positions. But my readings don’t agree, and I can’t determine whether the inconsistency is error or something else.”  

Brandeur’s eyebrows rose slightly. He reached for the papers, and I let him take them. For a long moment, he said nothing. His eyes moved across my notations, my diagrams, my work. I watched for dismissal, for refusal, for some sign of the cost.  

Instead, his shoulders unknotted and his breathing eased. The wariness in his eyes gave way to the hunger of someone who had been starving for work that mattered.  

“What do these groupings represent? You’ve labeled them one through four.”  

“Different observation platforms,” I said, which was true enough. “At different elevations.”  

“And the readings within each level are consistent, but the levels disagree with each other?”  

“Yes. I can’t figure out why.”  

Brandeur made a small sound, something between a grunt and acknowledgment. He pulled a fresh sheet of paper toward himself and began to work.  

I waited.  

Minutes passed. Brandeur filled one sheet with calculations, then another. He cross-referenced my numbers, drew diagrams, scratched out figures and rewrote them. His face had entirely lost its guarded quality. He looked like a different man. Engaged. Animated. Alive in a way I had never seen during admissions or faculty meetings.  

“Interesting,” he murmured, half to himself. “Very interesting.”  

“What do you see?”  

He held up one finger, asking for patience. He worked for several more minutes, filling a third sheet with figures. Then he set down his pen. “You have two problems,” he said. “Not one. Two distinct anomalies, and you’ve been treating them as a single error.”  

“Two problems?”  

He tapped the papers I had sorted by floor. “First, your readings from your primary observation level. This one.” He indicated my sub-two measurements. “These readings cluster into two distinct groups. Watch.”  

He drew a diagram, plotting my angles as lines radiating from their observation points. “Your early readings intersect here.” He marked a point. “Your later readings intersect here.” He marked another point. “The gap between these clusters is too large to explain by measurement uncertainty alone.”  

“How can you be sure?”  

“Statistics.” He wrote a formula I did not recognize. “Given your stated precision and the number of observations in each cluster, I can calculate the probability that both clusters represent the same true location. That probability is very small. Less than one in a thousand. It just doesn’t look so distinct on the paper because of the substantial vertical adjustment.”  

“So it moved,” I said slowly.  

“Yes.” Brandeur shuffled through the papers again, his enthusiasm undimmed. “The second problem is more interesting. Look at your data from each level separately.”  

He spread out four sheets, each containing one level’s worth of measurements. “Level one. The readings cluster tightly here.” He marked a point. “Level two. Tight cluster here, or rather, two clusters, as we discussed. Level three, tight cluster here. Level four, here.”  

I looked at the four points. They were nowhere near each other.  

“If your target is stationary, or even if it moved once, as we’ve established, these four points should coincide. They don’t. Each level gives you a completely different answer.” Brandeur pulled out a fresh sheet and began sketching rapidly. “But watch what happens when I plot the vertical position.”  

He drew a simple graph, elevation on one axis, observation level on the other. Four points appeared, then he drew a horizontal line through them. “All four levels agree perfectly on the elevation. Your target is at the exact same height, regardless of which floor you measured from.”  

I stared at the line.  

“According to statistics,” Brandeur continued, “if these were truly four different objects scattered across space, the probability they would all share the exact same elevation is vanishingly small. This confirms what the movement data already suggested. You’re measuring a single object.”  

The weight lifted from my chest. A single object.  

“But now we come to the interesting part.” He returned to his diagram of the four horizontal positions. “Look at the disagreement here. If this were random error, the four points would scatter in random directions. But they don’t.”  

He drew lines connecting the four points. They formed a rough spiral pattern, each point rotated relative to the last.  

“The disagreement is systematic,” he said. “Each level’s answer is rotated relative to the others. As if.”  

He trailed off, waiting for me.  

I stared at the spiral pattern. Rotated. Each level rotated relative to the others.  

“The coordinate systems,” I said, the words coming fast as the pieces clicked into place. “What if the reference frame at level one is rotated relative to level two? And level two is rotated relative to level three? That would explain exactly this pattern.”  

Brandeur looked up at me, and I saw genuine pleasure in his eyes. The satisfaction of a teacher whose student had just made a leap. “Precisely. You’ve been assuming your coordinate systems align. That ’north’ at level one points the same direction as ’north’ at level two. But your data suggests otherwise. Each level seems to have its own orientation, rotated relative to the others.”  

“But why would reference frames rotate between levels?”  

“I have no idea.” Brandeur shrugged. “I don’t know what you’re measuring or where you’re measuring it. I only know what the numbers say. And the numbers say your coordinate systems don’t align.” He gathered my papers into a neat stack and held them out to me. “Whatever space you’re working in, it’s not oriented the way you think it is. Fix your coordinate transformations, and your data will converge.”  

I took the papers. Rotating coordinate systems. Reference frames that shifted between levels. What could possibly cause that?  

“How do I fix it?” I asked. “If I don’t know how much each level is rotated?”  

“Measure it.” Brandeur’s tone was practical now, a teacher assigning homework. “Find some way to determine the angular offset between your reference frames. Then transform all your observations into a single unified system. The mathematics is straightforward. I can show you the rotation formulas if you need them.”  

He did then, spending another quarter hour walking me through the process of transforming coordinates from one rotated frame to another. He was a good teacher. Genuinely good. Patient and clear, building each concept on the foundation of the last. Nothing like the silent antagonist I had imagined from years of watching him vote against me at Hemme’s side.  

I wondered, for the first time, how much of that had been his choice. Hemme had a talent for finding people’s weaknesses and pressing on them. Brandeur was not a man who made friends easily. I could see that in the relief on his face when I’d walked through his door. If Hemme had been one of the only people to show him kindness, to include him, to make him feel like he belonged.  

It would not excuse what had happened. But it might explain it.  

“Thank you,” I said, gathering my papers. “This has been more helpful than I expected.”  

Brandeur nodded, and I saw what might have been gratitude in his eyes. “It’s been a fascinating problem,” he said.  

### * * *  

After leaving Brandeur’s office, I went straight to the Archives to see for myself.  

On the main floor, I found a corridor that ran clearly east-west. I used the great doors as my reference, fixing the direction into my bones. Then I made my way to the stairwell that led down to sub-one.  

I had walked these stairs a hundred times before, never thinking to count the turns. Now I counted carefully. Quarter-turn. Half-turn. Three-quarters. Full rotation. Another quarter before the stairs opened onto sub-one.  

I stepped out into the corridor and stopped.  

The passage ran perpendicular to where I had expected it to run. I turned to face what should have been east, the direction I had fixed so carefully, and found myself looking at a wall.  

I had descended one level, and the world had turned around me.  

I walked the corridors of sub-one until I found the stairwell to sub-two. Again I counted the turns as I descended. More this time. The stairwell spiraled deeper, carrying me down and around in a smooth curve. When I emerged onto sub-two, I stopped and faced the direction I had come from.  

The corridor had rotated again.  

I continued to sub-three, counting each turn with growing certainty. By the time I reached sub-three, the pattern was unmistakable. Each stairwell turned through its own measure, each level opening at a different angle.  

I stood in the corridor outside Puppet’s room and pictured it. Sub-one, turned on its axis relative to the main floor. Sub-two, turned again relative to sub-one. Sub-three, turned once more. Each level connected to the next by a single stairwell, but that connection was a pivot point, not an anchor. The floors did not stack like plates in a cupboard. They spiraled like a nautilus shell, each chamber extending in a different direction from the one above.  

Puppet had lived on sub-three for years. He claimed his room was directly beneath the Four-Plate Door, two levels above. He spoke of listening for sounds through the stone, of pressing his ear to the ceiling and imagining what secrets might be kept just overhead.  

But he was nowhere near the door. The geometry of the Archives had fooled him as thoroughly as it had fooled me.  

I climbed back to the main floor, my verification complete. The floors rotated, just as Brandeur had said. But knowing was not enough. I needed measurements. Real measurements. Precise angles that I could trust.  

My internal compass was worthless for this. I needed tools.  

I made my way to the Fishery and gathered what I needed. A surveyor’s compass with a sighting vane. A long measuring cord marked at regular intervals. A plumb line with a heavy brass weight.  

I returned to the Archives in the early afternoon and spent the next several hours with my surveyor’s compass and measuring cord. The main floor. Sub-one. Sub-two. Sub-three. Each level measured with exquisite care, each bearing recorded with precision that made my earlier attempts look like guesswork.  

The numbers were better than I had hoped. Twenty-three degrees on the main floor. Sixty-eight on sub-one. One hundred fifty-eight on sub-two. Two hundred eighteen on sub-three. A perfect spiral, each level rotating clockwise from the one above.  

I climbed back to my room as the afternoon light faded and spread my notebooks across the desk. The work of transforming coordinates took hours. I had to apply each rotation in sequence, building a map of how the floors truly related to each other, not how they seemed within the Archives’ twisted geometry.  

By evening, the clusters converged. All four floors, all agreeing, all pointing to the same location.  

Thirty feet north of the Archives’ exterior wall. At an elevation just below ground level.  

I pulled out my rough map of the University grounds and traced a line from the Archives, through the Four-Plate Door, and into the hill beyond. The line did not stop at the building’s foundation. It continued, following sub-two’s twisted orientation, reaching toward a different building entirely.  

It ended beneath Mains.  

I sat back and stared at my diagram. The Four-Plate Door was on sub-two, deep underground. But due to the rotated geometry of the Archives, sub-two extended not directly beneath the building but outward, into the hill. The door’s corridor extended toward Mains like a root seeking water.  

And the room beyond the door was not in the Archives at all. It was beneath the oldest building on campus.  

And Puppet, poor Puppet, had spent years listening for secrets through a ceiling that was nowhere near the room he sought, never thinking to question what seemed so obviously true.  

The geometry of the Archives had fooled him as thoroughly as it had fooled me.  

I glanced out the window. The sun was setting. I had just enough time to make it to Corners if I left now. After yesterday, I couldn’t leave Sim and Wil waiting again.  

But I allowed myself one more moment to stare at the diagram, at the thin line reaching from the Archives toward Mains.  

Then I gathered my things and headed for the door.  

### * * *  

Corners that evening took some time to become a relief. Sim, Wil, Fela, and I claimed our usual table at Anker’s. The first hand, I missed a crucial trick through a sequence I should have seen coming three plays earlier. Wil raised an eyebrow at my distraction but said nothing. A tankard of ale helped. Then, a few more hands, and gradually the game pulled me in. For a few hours the world narrowed to cards, friends, and the comfortable rhythm of play.  

When we finally dispersed near midnight, I headed toward Mains. Most of its windows were dark. I circled to the eastern side, climbed the old drainage pipe, and within minutes pulled myself onto the lower rooftop. From there I picked my way across the chaotic landscape of peaks and valleys, testing each handhold, moving with care.  

A few compass readings from different positions gave me what I needed. The lines converged on a section of roof between two taller wings. I moved there and checked my compass one final time. The needle pulled hard toward the rooftop beneath my feet, tilted at such a steep angle that I knew I was nearly centered above my book.  

It seemed so unlikely that I moved to the edge and peered down. Just to verify.  

And sure enough, below was Auri’s abandoned courtyard and apple tree.  

I sat back and pulled out my blueprints, sketching in the courtyard’s position. Thirty feet across. The blank wall formed its northern border. The hidden room would lie fifteen feet behind that wall, perhaps extending another fifteen feet beyond. The entire space would fit within Mains’ foundation.  

I looked down at the blank wall again, at the peaceful courtyard in the moonlight. How many times had I practiced here, never thinking to question why one wall lacked windows? How many times had I met with Auri, never knowing what lay just beyond?  

The geometry was clear now. The Four-Plate Door sat both in the Archives and beneath Mains. I gathered my compass and diagrams, and headed back toward my room. But I already knew where my steps would take me next.
