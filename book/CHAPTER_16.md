# CHAPTER 16.

## INTERLUDE.

## OMENS.


THE DECK BOARDS outside the Waystone creaked, groaning with the weight of age and weather, or perhaps with the secrets they held. Inside, the low hum of conversation fell abruptly silent, the way it does when an autumn chill presses against the windows, and the wind whips a tired shutter against its home.

A moment passed, and the door swung inward with a weary reluctance. Old Cob stepped through, familiar and worn as an old coin, his boots scuffing against the hardwood as if even the floor itself resisted interrupting the quiet.

“A pint o’ cider, Kote,” he grunted, stomping dust and dead grass from his boots before making his way to the bar. He slid into his usual place, the grooves of the stool seeming to fit him by now. “Helluva long morning. Don’t s’pose there’s any o’ that pie left?”

“No pie, I’m afraid,” Kote said, his voice polite, apologetic. But his hands worked with the assurance of long habit as he pulled a tankard off the shelf, wiping its rim reflexively before pouring the cider. Each movement was efficient, unhurried. If the creak of the boards outside had put a sliver of tension into him, it didn’t show.

Cob clicked his tongue, disappointment quick and sharp. “Pity, that. Best thing to keep you going, you know. Something warm and sweet.”

Kote slid the cider across the counter with a nod, and Cob took it with both hands, drinking half in one pull. He let out a satisfied sigh, setting the tankard down with a soft thunk against the wood. “Now, that’s good. Nothing like cider to settle the dust in your throat.”

He leaned against the bar, his face shifting into something more serious, though it stayed shaded by familiarity’s easy mask. “By the by, I had a talk with the Bentleys earlier. Seen ’em packing up all their things. Big wagon hitched out front, stuff tied down like they meant it for good and proper leavin’.”

“Did they say why?” Kote asked, still polite, still calm. He set the now-empty pitcher aside softly and deliberately. The gesture felt like the fading echo of a dropped pin.

Cob nodded, his lips pressing thin, as if chewing on something bitter. “Aye. Say they saw a something lurkin’ in their backwoods last night. Not quite a man, exactly. Sarah say it didn’t walk right. Legs too long, or too lean. Arms hanging all too low. Gave her the shivers, summat fierce.”

His eyes darted to the window, as if expecting to see the shadow of his words pressed against the glass. “Couldn’t talk her outta it. Say she knew what she saw and didn’t want to stay and see it again.”

Kote didn’t move except to stifle a yawn with the back of his hand. He set the bar rag down, folded neatly over his fingers. “That’s a bit of bad luck,” he said mildly.

Cob snorted, finishing off the cider with a flick of his wrist. “Luck?” He set the tankard down and jabbed a thumb toward the door. “Luck ain’t got a whit to do with it. It’s all this blasted nonsense springin’ up. Shep gone, Carter bringin’ in that odd thing from the woods, soldiers n’ bandits thick as flies on the road. I tell ya, Kote, the Bentleys might have the right of it, runnin’ while they’ve got the legs for it.”

He pushed away from the bar with a groan, his joints popping loud enough to carry in the quiet. “Anyway, I’d best be off. Things to tend to, as ever.” He gave Kote a short nod and turned toward the door, boots heavy against the floor like punctuation to his words.

The door closed behind him with a finality that seemed almost rude and left behind a louder silence than before.

Kote remained behind the bar, poised in his stillness for just a moment longer. There was nothing unusual in what Cob had said. The superstitious mutterings reflected the usual fears of things that slink under the moon. People had left town before. People had come back.

Still, he leaned slightly, listening until Cob’s footfalls were no longer audible on the deck boards outfront. Then he moved back to the table at the far end of the common room, where the Chronicler waited. The man’s quill hung above the page, its tip blotting a small dot of ink onto the margin.  

“Where were we?” Kote asked, his voice lighter now, casual as a well-worn cloak.  

The Chronicler didn’t answer right away because he was too busy scanning the last few lines of what he had written. His fingers hovered over the edges of the page. After a moment, he finally spoke. “You were on your way to Renere,” he said.

Kote nodded, but the moment to begin didn’t come right away. He rested his hand idly on the table, his fingers just brushing the edge of the wood. The fire’s light chased shadows down the wall, their shapes twisting and flickering in ways Kote didn’t much care for. He let himself glance at the door, just once, before reaching for the story again.

“Yes,” Kote said softly. “Renere.”
