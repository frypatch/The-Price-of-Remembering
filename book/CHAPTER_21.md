# CHAPTER 21.

## KAYSERA.


THE WHITE CITADEL baked under the noon sun, its sandstone walls almost glowing in the heat. The courtyard stretched wide and empty, save for the crowd pressed along the edges. Their whispers curled through the air like smoke. Trellises of red selas flowers framed the space, as if this duel were part of some cruel performance.

We'd drawn a sizable crowd, a few hundred strong watching from the courtyard’s fringes or staring down from the Citadel's stone walkways. At its center stood Lord Vatis. His cream shirt clung to his skin, the cut of his leather armor tight and precise. His rapier sliced through the air in slow arcs, the whistling blade drawing attention like a hawk circling above. As I approached, his eyes landed on me with bright satisfaction.

Beyond him, the Jakis family gathered, impossible to miss with their garish ornamentation. Silks the color of spilled wine, collars stiff as judgment, gold glinting at every wrist and throat.

Ambrose leaned forward, his smirk wound tight as a knotted snare. Behind him, his father lounged with the quiet confidence of a man who expected to win. His patience held steady, measured and sure, the kind practiced a thousand times and always met with its due reward.

Standing beside them was regent Fascino. Yet it was not his presence that caught my eye. My attention slid instead to the woman he faced, speaking in low, easy tones. Meluan. I could not say whether she had come for the wedding or if she had arrived on the very wind of this duel. Still, it was easy to imagine a spring in her step, cruel delight nesting in her smile, eager for the moment I might be brought low. My free hand tightened to a fist, and the wooden ring bit at my skin. Her gift. Her token.

Not all stood so pleased. At her side, Stapes hovered, dutiful and grave, eyes darting, jaw clenched. The Maer’s manservant, close but never quite at ease. Was Alveron here as well? The question burned at me. If he were, surely he would already have made himself known. No. He would not leave Meluan to stand alone.

Though the prevailing court of opinion was clearly against me, I had at least one person on my side, Bast having accompanied me. Wil and Sim, to their credit, managed halfway before turning back, not wanting to risk the sight of their friend’s blood.

“Kvothe,” Bast murmured from behind me, his voice almost amused.

I glanced back. He wasn’t pale, wasn’t afraid. If anything, he looked mildly exasperated. His arms were crossed.

“You know,” he mused, tilting his head, “the best stories never end with a hero bleeding out in the dust over a noble’s bruised pride.”

I narrowed my eyes. “That supposed to comfort me?”

Bast smirked. “Only if you believe in stories.”

He rocked back on his heels. “Just don’t embarrass me in front of these fine people.”

I shook my head, “Watch my back.”

His expression flickered, just slightly. The banter lifted and a more serious look settled over him. “Always.”

In front of me, Lord Vatis's lips twisted into something between a grin and a warning. “You’ve kept me waiting,” he taunted.

I didn’t answer. My hand rested briefly on the hilt of Caesura, then drew it, the blade giving a faint, muted hum like muffled bells. The sound pulled a hush from the crowd, though more out of curiosity than awe. Vatis paused, his grin faltering as he eyed the sword. He didn’t recognize Saicere, which meant he didn’t understand what he was seeing. I could work with that.

### * * *

The air held still for a breath.

Then the string snapped. Vatis moved.

His rapier blurred toward me, a blade flashing as swift as a striking kestrel. I caught the motion with Threshing Wheat, turning the blade aside in a clean and measured arc. The ring of steel hummed between us, soft as an opening note.

Vatis pressed forward, relentless but precise. His footwork moved with the careful rhythm of a practiced dance. He was fast, much faster than I had expected.

But even as I blocked and stepped back, I did not strike.

Not yet.

Instead, I adjusted. Tilted. Shifted.

A step just slightly slower than it should be. The weight carried just a fraction off-center. Small things and subtle things that build together into a pattern. These are the kinds of mistakes a predator expects from weaker prey.

And Vatis? He noticed them.

And that’s exactly what I wanted.

His blade flicked faster, controlling the pace and forcing me to react, or at least making it appear that way.

I caught his strikes cleanly, parried lightly where I could, but never countered aggressively.

Nothing bold. Nothing desperate. Just slow, quiet loss.

I felt him maneuvering me. Subtle and careful. Guiding, but not pressing.

He knew this wasn’t finished. Not yet.

The feint came low. A sharp twist. A testing flick.

I saw it a breath before it landed. Chose, quietly, where to let him take me.

A sting across my forearm, clean and sharp.

Blood welled. Small, contained. Harmless.

“First blood.”

The words rolled smooth from his tongue, smug but polite, measured and easy. He flicked the edge of his rapier once, casting aside my blood like a thing barely worth keeping. His stance was elegant, almost careless.

The crowd rustled. An applause here and there with murmurs of polite approval.

I didn’t move.

Not angered. Not shocked. I only adjusted the fingers around Saicere’s hilt and exhaled.

One step in a deeper game.

I rolled my shoulder and flexed my fingers once. The sting along my arm was a thoughtless thing, unimportant. The true injury had nothing to do with blood.

I met Vatis’s gaze, calm and expectant.

I had waited for this moment, but that didn’t mean I liked it.

Then, as I had suspected, Fascino spoke.

“Oh, surely not.”

The words hummed through the courtyard like a perfect note, softly played.

Vatis turned his head slightly, brow quirking as if he hadn’t quite heard correctly. Or perhaps he was acting once again.

Fascino strode forward from the nobility’s ranks, his movements too smooth, too practiced. This was not a request. This was steering.

“A true duel,” Fascino mused, tilting his head. “Settled with this?” He gestured toward the thin line of red beneath my sleeve with mocking delicacy.

The statement wasn’t meant for me. It was for Vatis.

Vatis exhaled sharply through his nose. His posture shifted. Not by much, but enough.

Fascino’s lips curled slightly. “Unless, of course, you’d rather this moment be remembered in smaller terms.”

Vatis straightened, a movement just barely reactionary. He glanced out toward the gathering nobility, toward Ambrose, Meluan, the lords and ladies who would remember this moment in every retelling.

Perception. Stories. Legacy.

The nobility had gathered like vultures, waiting to see how the story would go. Ambrose, resting easy in his seat, already knew his version.

I stayed perfectly still.

Because I had predicted all of it.

Vatis’s mouth lifted in a smooth, unbothered grin, but something behind his eyes glinted sharper now.

“He’s right,” Vatis murmured, lifting his blade. He turned, addressing the court as much as he addressed me. “This barely qualifies as a wound.”

He smiled wide. Unshaken. Polished as a speaking stone.

“Let’s continue.”

Now the game was truly mine.

### * * *

Vatis struck first.

He was faster now. Not reckless, but deliberate in a way he hadn’t been before. He had something to prove, to himself and to the court.

But in his renewed confidence, he didn’t notice that I was not the same opponent he had been fighting before.

Before, I had let him pull me into his rhythm.

Now, I was adjusting it. I moved with care, note by note, half-step by half-step. Each change was subtle, just enough that he would not notice.

I angled my shoulders, letting my weight flow differently, subtly shifting into Ademic movement. I was no longer dueling. I was dancing.

Vatis pressed, sensing he was still in control.

That was his mistake.

I turned a breath too quickly, letting him anticipate a false pattern.

A flicker of hesitation. Small, barely perceptible, but I saw it.

The game closed.

Momentum shifted.

Suddenly, somehow, he was overextended without quite knowing why.

His footwork, pristine moments ago, was now faltering at the edges.

I saw his calm expression tighten ever so slightly as awareness crept in.

Something was wrong.

He no longer understood why this was happening.

But he understood that it was.

Before he could adjust, I moved.

A single fluid cut. Not deep, but placed where it mattered. A kiss of Saicere across the inside of his thigh.

The kind of cut that did not kill but did not forgive.

Vatis choked a breath, his stance lost in an instant.

His legs shook beneath him.

He tried twisting past the injury, but something failed.

There was a sharp, cracking break. Small but definitive.

Then his rapier slipped, clattering onto the stone.

The crowd gasped.

I didn’t press forward. Didn’t move.

I only watched as he realized what I already knew.

It was over.

But the realization arrived too late for him to disguise it.

His knee buckled. Not dramatically. Not all at once.

Just enough.

Just enough for everyone to see.

He drew in one hard, shallow breath. He had not yet fallen, but his pride was already breaking.

For the first time, his expression lost all its ease.

His gaze flickered, not to me, not to the blood staining his silk, but toward the watching stage.

Toward Nobles. Toward Ambrose.

Toward Fascino, who stood precisely as he had before.

Had his plan truly unraveled? Or was this just a deeper layer?

He would not find the answer.

I lowered Saicere’s blade. Felt the weight of the moment press into the quiet.

Then, finally, I spoke.

“Yield,” I said steadily. “And remember it was an Edema Ruh who let you live.”

Vatis’s gaze flickered. His jaw was tight.

Then, at last, grinding the words out through clenched teeth, came his voice.

"I yield."

The script was shattered, the onlookers frozen in time. Unable to react to such impossibility.

Then across the courtyard, I saw Fascino's shoulders move as if to let out a quiet sigh. Shaking his head as if disappointed, he turned and left before the first medic even got to Vantis.

To the right, another shift of movement caught my eye. Glancing after it, I saw the wind scatter Auri's hair like autumn leaves in the far cloister.

She did not move. She did not wave. She was watching. That thought sat uneasily in my ribs, like a string tuned too tight. Had she always been there? Was it chance? Or had she known?

The courtyard faded behind me as I turned and walked away, pressing my hand against my wound. My focus lingered only on the thought of the tower. If I couldn’t save her through Roderick, I would find another way.
