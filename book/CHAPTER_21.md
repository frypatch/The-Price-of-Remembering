# CHAPTER 21.

## KAYSERA.


THE WHITE CITADEL baked under the noon sun, its sandstone walls almost glowing in the heat. The courtyard stretched wide, its center bare and bright, the crowd pressed tight along the edges. Trellises of selas framed the space, as if this duel were part of some cruel performance.  

We’d drawn a sizable crowd, a few hundred strong watching from the courtyard’s fringes and staring down from the Citadel’s stone walkways. At its center stood Lord Vatis. His cream shirt clung to his skin, the cut of his leather armor tight and precise. His rapier sliced through the air in slow arcs, the whistling blade drawing attention like a hawk circling above. As I approached, his eyes landed on me with bright satisfaction.  

Beyond him, the Jakis family gathered, impossible to miss with their garish ornamentation. Silks the color of spilled wine, collars stiff as judgment, gold glinting at every wrist and throat. Ambrose leaned forward, his smirk wound tight as a knotted snare. Behind him, his father lounged with the quiet confidence of a man who expected to win. His patience held steady, measured and sure, the kind practiced a thousand times and always met with its due reward.  

Standing beside them was regent Fascino. Yet it was not his presence that caught my eye. My attention slid instead to the woman Fascino stood beside, his posture easy, his gestures unhurried. Meluan. I could not say whether she had come for the betrothal or if she had arrived on the very wind of this duel. Still, it was easy to imagine a spring in her step, cruel delight nesting in her smile, eager for the moment I might be brought low. My free hand tightened to a fist, and the wooden ring bit at my skin. Her judgment, my spite.  

Not all stood so pleased. At her side, Stapes hovered, dutiful and grave, eyes darting, his hands busy at nothing, fingers working the cuff of his sleeve. The Maer’s manservant, close but never quite at ease. Was Alveron here as well? The question burned at me. If he were, surely he would already have made himself known. No. He would not leave Meluan to stand alone.  

It was not lost on me that the court stood against me, near to a man. But Bast had come, which was something. Wil and Sim, to their credit, managed halfway before turning back, not wanting to risk the sight of their friend’s blood.  

I glanced back. Bast looked mildly exasperated. His arms were crossed, his weight settled on his heels as if he had arrived at a play he’d already decided was beneath him.  

“You know,” he mused, pressing a clay cup into my hands, “the tales worth telling never end with heroes bleeding in the dust for some lord’s wounded pride.”  

I looked down. The dark tea had gone cold. “That supposed to comfort me?”  

His expression softened, just slightly. The teasing drained away and something older looked out through his eyes. “It’s in all the stories,” he said quietly.  

I tossed the tea back in two forced swallows, the bitterness clinging to my tongue like something dead. But within moments, the tremor in my right hand quieted to a murmur. “Watch my back.”  

Then the nahlrout opened its eyes inside me. The courtyard sharpened. Every edge grew precise. The noon sun struck the sandstone like a hammer on bright metal and I could see each grain of dust turning in the air above Vatis’s blade. I could count the stitching on his leather armor. I could read the faces in the crowd the way you read a sheet of music, each one a note placed exactly where it needed to be.  

I knew this clarity. I knew, too, that it would not last forever.  

In front of me, Lord Vatis’s lips twisted into something between a grin and a warning. “You’ve kept me waiting,” he taunted.  

I didn’t answer. I rested my hand briefly on the hilt of Caesura, then drew it, the blade giving a faint, muted hum like muffled bells. The sound pulled a hush from the crowd, though more out of curiosity than awe. Vatis eyed the sword. He didn’t recognize Saicere, which meant he didn’t understand what he was seeing. I could work with that.  

The air held still for a breath.  

Then the string snapped. Vatis moved.  

His rapier blurred toward me, the blade flashing as swift as a striking kestrel. I caught the motion with Threshing Wheat, turning the blade aside in a clean and measured arc. The ring of steel hummed between us, soft as an opening note. The vibration sang up through my wrist and settled in the bones of my forearm.  

Vatis pressed forward, relentless but precise. His feet traced the careful rhythm of a practiced dance. He was fast, much faster than I had expected.  

But even as I blocked and stepped back, I did not strike.  

Not yet.  

Instead, I adjusted. Tilted. Shifted.  

A step just slightly slower than it should be. The weight carried just a fraction off-center. Small things and subtle things that build together into a pattern. These are the kinds of mistakes a predator expects from weaker prey.  

And Vatis? He noticed them.  

And that’s exactly what I wanted.  

His blade flicked faster, controlling the pace and forcing me to react, or at least making it appear that way.  

I caught his strikes cleanly, parried where I could, gave ground where I had to, each retreat bringing the heat of a new patch of sunbaked stone through the soles of my boots and each parry driving that bright hum deeper into my wrist until the bones of my hand rang with it. Nothing bold. Nothing desperate. Just slow, quiet loss.  

I felt him maneuvering me. Subtle and careful. Guiding, but not pressing.  

He knew this wasn’t finished. Not yet.  

The feint came low. A sharp twist. A testing flick.  

I saw it a breath before it landed. Chose, quietly, where to let him take me.  

A sting across my forearm, clean and sharp.  

Blood welled. Or should have. What came was thin, reluctant, barely enough to darken the edge of his rapier. The nahlrout doing its other work.  

“First blood.”  

The words rolled smooth from his tongue, smug but polite, measured and easy. He flicked the edge of his rapier once, casting aside what little there was. He held his stance with elegant carelessness.  

The crowd rustled. Murmurs of polite approval, though some leaned forward, squinting, as if unsure whether that could possibly be it.  

My fingers settled around Saicere’s hilt. I exhaled.  

One step in a deeper game.  

The sting along my arm was a thoughtless thing, barely worth noticing. I rolled my shoulder once and met Vatis’s gaze across the quiet. He watched me with calm expectation, still certain of the shape of things.  

I had waited for this moment. That didn’t mean I liked it. The nahlrout still held, the world still burning bright and sharp, but I could feel the edge of it now, the way you can feel the last hour of a candle.  

Then, as I had suspected, Fascino spoke.  

“Oh, surely not.”  

The words hummed through the courtyard like a perfect note, softly played. His gaze lingered on my arm, on the cut that had drawn so little red. Something flickered behind his composure, a calculation revised.  

Vatis turned his head slightly, brow quirking as if he hadn’t quite heard correctly. Or perhaps he was acting once again.  

Fascino strode forward from the nobility’s ranks, every step a quiet command.  

“A true duel,” Fascino said, letting the words carry. “Settled with this?” He gestured toward my sleeve with mocking delicacy. Toward the cut that barely bled. “Unless, of course, you’d rather this moment be remembered in smaller terms.”  

Vatis held perfectly still. Only his fingers moved, shifting on the rapier’s grip, a small adjustment that meant nothing and everything. Then he glanced out toward the gathering nobility, toward Ambrose, Meluan, the lords and ladies who would remember this moment in every retelling.  

This was never about blood. It was about watching an Edema Ruh reminded of his station.  

The nobility leaned in from every side, eager as an Eolian crowd before the third song, the one that decides whether you earn your talent pipes or leave empty-handed. Ambrose, resting easy in his seat, already knew his version.  

I held my ground, which is easy enough when you have seen the whole board laid bare before the first piece moves.  

Vatis’s mouth lifted in a smooth, unbothered grin, but something behind his eyes glinted sharper now. “He’s right,” he murmured, lifting his blade. He turned, addressing the court as much as he addressed me. “This barely qualifies as a wound.” He smiled wide. Unshaken. Polished as a courtier’s smile. “Let’s continue.”  

Vatis struck first. He was faster now. Not reckless, but deliberate in a way he hadn’t been before. He had something to prove, to himself and to the court.  

But in his renewed pride, he didn’t notice that I was not the same opponent he had been fighting before.  

Before, I had let him pull me into his rhythm.  

Now, I was adjusting it. I moved with care, note by note, half-step by half-step. Each change was subtle, just enough that he would not notice.  

I angled my shoulders, letting my weight flow differently, subtly shifting into Ademic movement, and for a moment everything aligned, the bright clarity of the nahlrout and the deep muscle-memory of the Ketan moving together so that I could feel Vatis’s rhythm the way you feel the tempo of a song, his weight shifting a half-beat before his blade followed, the opening forming in his guard like a rest between notes. I was no longer dueling. I was dancing.  

Vatis pressed, sensing he was still in control. He drove a sharp combination, high then low, and I caught both cleanly but let my counter arrive a half-step late, close enough to seem earnest, slow enough to confirm what he already believed.  

That was his mistake.  

I turned a breath too quickly, letting him anticipate a false pattern. He lunged to punish it and I pivoted, guiding his blade past me and letting his own momentum carry him a fraction too far forward.  

A flicker of hesitation. Small, barely perceptible, but I saw it.  

He struck again, a lateral cut aimed at my ribs, but his feet had not fully recovered from the lunge and the blow arrived without his weight behind it. I turned it aside with Saicere and stepped off the line, forcing him to pivot on the leg I had already chosen.  

His footwork, pristine moments ago, faltered at the edges.  

I saw his calm expression tighten ever so slightly as awareness crept in. He tested with a quick thrust, felt the resistance I offered, and pulled back. But pulling back put him where I wanted him, and the next exchange carried him a shade past his balance.  

Something was wrong. He no longer understood why this was happening.  

But he understood that it was.  

Sweat had found the grip of my sword. I shifted my fingers once, settling them. The sun pressed on my shoulders like a hand.  

Before he could adjust, I moved.  

A single fluid cut. Not deep, but placed where it mattered. A kiss of Saicere across the inside of his thigh.  

The kind of cut that did not kill but did not forgive.  

Vatis choked a breath, his stance lost in an instant.  

He tried twisting past the injury, but something failed. His weight shifted wrong, the knee turning where the muscle could no longer hold it. Something inside the joint gave with a wet, tearing sound, quiet and final.  

Then the leg folded and took the rest of him with it. An ugly, sudden collapse, the kind a body makes when something fundamental gives way. He threw his hand out to catch himself and the rapier’s tip caught in the seam between courtyard stones. The blade bowed, flexed, and sprang free with a vicious snap, the flat of it whipping across his cheek and opening a thin line of red beneath his eye before the rapier clattered across the pavers and came to rest in the dust.  

The crowd gasped.  

His own sword had marked him on the way down.  

I stepped forward and looked down at him. His gaze flickered, not to me, not to the blood darkening his leg or the new line on his face, but toward the watching stage. Toward nobles. Toward Ambrose. Toward Fascino, who stood precisely as he had before.  

Had his plan truly unraveled? Or was this just a deeper layer? He would not find the answer.  

He drew in one hard, shallow breath. He had not yet risen, and his pride was already breaking.  

I held Saicere steady. Felt the weight of the moment press into the quiet. Then, finally, I spoke.  

“Yield,” I said steadily. “And remember it was an Edema Ruh who let you live.”  

Vatis’s eyes found mine. Then, at last, grinding the words out through clenched teeth, came his voice.  

“I yield.”  

The courtyard held its breath. The crowd had come expecting a familiar tune, and what they had heard was something else entirely.  

I caught movement at the edge of the crowd. Fascino turned from the nearest column, shaking his head as though disappointed by a poor hand at cards, and walked away before the first medic even reached Vatis.  

Beyond the retreating figure, something else. A flutter of pale fabric in the far cloister.  

Auri.  

The wind scattered her hair like autumn leaves. She stood still among the stone pillars, and beside her, half in the column’s shadow, stood Trenati. Her brother.  

Behind me, the crowd had started to stir. I heard voices rising, uncertain, already beginning to shape what they had seen into something they could carry home and tell. And threaded through the murmur, so faint I might have imagined it, a word I did not know.  

*Kaysera.*  

A wrong name spoken with the right conviction. That is how stories begin. The truth never catches up.
