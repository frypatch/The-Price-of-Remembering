# CHAPTER 13

## I WILL NOT BE HELD  

LOVE IS A soft and precarious thing, often born in silence, nurtured by proximity, and sharpened by shared purpose. I didn’t realize it at first – how my feelings toward Devi had grown roots, twining quietly around the edges of my thoughts. It was easy to ignore at first. She was quick-barked and bristling, as dangerous as a double-edged knife: brilliant, beautiful, and cursed with a sharpness that kept most people at arm’s length.  

But in the snug chaos of her small room, beneath the hum of sympathy wax and the bite of hot iron in the air, I discovered her warmth in quieter gestures. How she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear when she was thinking, her sharp gaze softening in the firelight. How her laughter, rare as a frost-lotus bloom, carried an edge of steel but landed soft all the same.  

And there was purpose. A shared endeavor sharpens trust like no whetstone can. Together, we had crafted a new art: pulling knowledge from behind impossible doors, bending what shouldn’t be bent. And for all her rough edges, she never felt like a threat.  

Devi became the only person in my life who seemed to understand the hunger inside me. For knowledge, for answers, for more. And it was beautiful, wasn’t it? To share this kind of closeness with someone who didn’t just tolerate my ambition but matched it, stroke for stroke.  

If you’d asked me then, I’d say I didn’t love her. At least, not in any way I could have explained. But looking back now, I know better.  

### * * *

Devi’s room felt tighter than usual, the air heavy with the smell of ink and hot iron. Her makeshift library loomed around us, stacks of ragged, half-stitched books leaning drunkenly against one another like a forgotten city wall. Once, their roughness bothered me—their bare spines and uneven stitching a quiet affront to the elegance of knowledge. Over time, I’d come to see them differently. Not relics to be admired, but tools meant for use.  

I ran my hand over one of the stacks as I passed, my fingers catching on the threadbare stitching. Each page felt liminal somehow, ready to become more yet just shy of completeness. Maybe that’s why I found it so easy to scribble and scrawl all over them, circling words, underlining passages, folding corners. Perfect knowledge demands reverence. But these? These felt like conspirators—and I was not above using them ruthlessly.  

On one such night, restless with the threads of our work, I leafed through a copy we had pulled from the Archives just days prior. It wasn’t much to look at—thin and unassuming, its copied letters uneven in places like a poor man’s shadow. Yet something in its contents caught on the edge of my thoughts.  

At first, it seemed a list of common superstitions: lights blue as flame, shadows moving unnaturally, and a grin too wide to be human. But buried deeper, sharp and tangled, I found stranger things.  

A shattered wheel.  
A broken song.  
A scar of iron.  

I doubted their accuracy. Still, the thread was impossible not to follow. It led me into an unfamiliar corner of the Archives, a particularly dim and dusty section I had little cause to visit before. There, nestled between volumes on agricultural charms and burial rites, I found the book.  

Black leather, cracked with age. The edges crumbled like old pastry as I slid it from the shelf, and I held my breath as the spine groaned in protest. Lighting my thief’s lamp, I opened the cover gingerly, savoring the musty fragrance of ancient parchment. The title greeted me in fading Temic—*En Temerant Voistra.*  

My pulse quickened as I began to read. Most of the text was indecipherable, a ravaged artifact of time and translation. Yet certain words leapt out, sharp as flint against the dark void of my ignorance.  

*Chandrian.*  

My hands trembled as I hunched over the tome. Proof. Not censored. Not hidden behind the Four-Plated Door. Here it had been all along, waiting to be uncovered! I skimmed as quickly as I dared, though the fragile pages resisted my eagerness. The passages spoke of things I did not yet understand—enigmatic connections, places, people.  

Then, in the edge of my vision movement caught my eye. A student sat bent over a stack of loose pages at the next desk. At first, I thought nothing of it—there’s an efficiency to solitude in the Archives, and you learn to ignore its other occupants. But something tugged at my attention.  

His hands glided over the manuscript as if searching for meaning. And then I saw it: the stitching. Crooked, uneven. Those ragged, naked spines. My spines. My stomach twisted, sharp and sudden. Devi had sold the copy.  

For a moment, I hesitated, lungs pulling shallow breaths as my options narrowed sharply in the still air. Confrontation was dangerous in the Archives; Lorren's rules were absolute, and this manuscript—ours—was no less dangerous in ways no one else yet understood.  

I forced my breath steady. “Excuse me,” I said, stepping closer. My voice was bright, light—a friendly tone perfected over years of winning favors when I had no right to ask for them.  

The student startled, glancing up like a cornered hare. His face was thin, pale under the faint glow of the thief's lamp on my belt. “What?” he managed, guarded but not wary enough.  

“Fascinating piece you’ve got there,” I said easily. “Those loose manuscripts—where did you find them? I’ve been trying to track down something nearly identical.”  

His hand instinctively tightened over the edges of the parchment. “It’s… for study,” he said evasively. “I found it at a merchant’s stall down in Imre.”  

“Ah, Imre,” I replied with a conspirator’s confidence, slipping into another well-worn role. “One of the undermerchants, I’d wager?” I leaned casually against the desk, as if it were mere curiosity driving me to linger. “Had to be. The proper stalls would never deal in something so rare.”  

The flattery worked; he eased slightly, lifting the corner of the page so I could catch a better glimpse. “Yes, I suppose so. It cost more than I’d have liked…”  

“But worth every coin, clearly,” I said quickly, nudging past his faint hesitation. I let my voice dip into a reverent hush, a trick I’d learned long ago when coaxing a shopkeeper into retrieving their best wares. “Tell me, would you mind if—just for a moment—I looked? I promise, I’d be careful.”  

His expression wavered, the instinct to protect giving way beneath the weight of my practiced charm. “I don’t…” He hesitated, finally loosening his grip on the manuscript. “Just for a moment.”  

My fingers brushed the edge of the parchment as I reached for it, careful to let my touch seem light, deferential. But as soon as it passed into my hands, my stance straightened—confident now, unyielding as stone.  

“Thank you,” I said, my gratitude genuine. “You’ve done the University a great service.” The words carried enough ambiguity to blur their meaning, and I didn’t wait for him to realize just how carefully I’d chosen them.  

Without another word, I turned sharply on my heel, the manuscript held close to my chest, and made my way out of the Archives before he could voice his confusion or protest. If he dared report me, he’d find himself in the same precarious trouble as I.  

By the time the great brass door of the Archives swung shut behind me, my knuckles ached from the strength of my grip, and my fury at Devi burned hotter than ever. 

### * * *  

The cobblestones of Imre echoed under my boots as I approached Devi’s shop. Each step carried me closer to a confrontation I hadn’t yet planned but burned to have. I was brimming with rage, anger so thick it coiled in my gut like an angry snake about to strike. But as I neared her door, I stopped short.  

Devi stood in the street, barefoot and furious, her hands loose at her sides. Her silhouette cut sharply against the dim light spilling from the streetlamp. Even without seeing her face, I knew something in her had come unmoored. But she wasn’t alone.  

Across from her stood Master Lorren. His calm facade shattered, his usual measured grace replaced by raw force and single-minded purpose. He was nothing like the Lorren I had ever seen. Backlit by a dim streetlamp, his stance was broad, his arms raised like steel girders. 

Devi stood opposite him, barefoot and wild-eyed, her disheveled frame seemingly untouched by the late hour or the tension that hung between them. Her grin was jagged as a splintered mirror, as though rage and triumph had struck her simultaneously.  

Lorren’s voice rang out, sharp as breaking ice: “Enough, Devi. This is your last chance to end this peacefully.”  

Her laugh was cutting, high and brittle. “Peacefully?” she echoed, her tone dripping venom. “Spare me. I know how this ends. You don’t care about peace. You care about *control.*”  

For the first time, Lorren faltered—nearly imperceptible but unsettlingly real. His Alar, an invisible tide pressing outward, stuttered momentarily. Devi seized the opportunity, her own Alar surging forward. The air seemed to ripple, visibly distorting for the briefest moment as though the two forces were tearing the world apart between them.  

“I won’t be held,” Devi hissed, her voice raw with something that sounded almost like despair. “Not by *you.* Not by any Master! Never again!”  

Her will lashed out like a whip, forcing Lorren to drop into a defensive stance. His breaths grew heavier, frost forming in his exhalations. Yet even as she pressed him, I could see it: Lorren wasn’t fighting to win. He was fighting to contain her. The difference was plain in every strained line of his face.  

It was her wild defiance against his measured inevitability. And she was winning.  

“Devi!” I called out, my voice breaking the silence of the knife-edged conflict.  

She turned, her Alar briefly brushing against mine. The force of it was staggering, a wave that nearly sent me reeling. I caught myself, reaching deep into the space between us with my own threads of intent. Barriers. Shields. Anything to stand against her.  

“Stop this.” My voice was hoarse, robbed of its deeper confidence. “This isn’t what you want.”  

Her smile twisted into something between pity and scorn. “Kvothe,” she said, her voice dripping acid. “You don’t **know** what I want!”  

Her Alar surged, grinding against mine like iron against flint. My head pounded as the binder’s chill crept deeper, turning my limbs heavy with frost. Across from us, Lorren rose to his full height, determination etched into his pale, dampened face. Together, with our forces combined, Devi began to stumble.  

I don’t know how long it lasted—the three of us locked in that silent, suffocating fight. Time ceased to matter in that place. Piece by piece, Devi’s strength faltered, though not from anything we did directly. She simply spent herself, burned too brightly for too long.

When she fell, it was as though someone had cut her strings. She crumpled to the cobblestones, her chest rising and falling shallowly as strands of hair clung to her sweat-slicked face.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. The chill in my veins spread faster now, turning each heartbeat into a slow, painful echo as darkness pulled at the edges of my vision. In the corner of my eye, I saw guards assembled, their presence both reassuring and ominous.  

And then, all at once, the blackness took me.
