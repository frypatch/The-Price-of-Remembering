# CHAPTER 13.

## I WILL NOT BE HELD.


LOVE IS A SOFT THING. Precarious, too. It grows in quiet places, in the hush between words. Born of nearness. Fed by purpose, drawn taut between two souls. I did not see it at first. My thoughts tangled quietly around Devi’s name, roots curling unseen and slow. Easy to step past, in the beginning. She was bristling and clever, quick as spilled wine, bright as broken glass, and just as sharp. Lovely and dangerous, a knife honed on both edges, promising pain for anyone who came too close.

Yet her warmth lived elsewhere, never in her words but in smaller things. In the snug tumult of her little room, steeped in the hum of sympathy wax and the sharp tang of hot iron, I watched her sharper lines go soft. A stray strand of hair brushed behind her ear, lost in thought. Firelight moving in her eyes. Her laughter, sharp and rare, blooming fierce as a frost-lotus, always with softness nestled at the heart.

And there was purpose. Shared purpose. Standing shoulder to shoulder against the impossible. Together, we made a new sort of art, pulling secrets from stubborn doors, bending what ought not to bend. For all her keen edges, she never felt like a threat.

Devi became the only person in my life who seemed to understand the hunger inside me. For knowledge, for answers, for more. And it was beautiful, wasn’t it? To share this kind of closeness with someone who didn’t just tolerate my ambition but matched it, stroke for stroke.

If you’d asked me then, I would have denied it. I would have said I didn’t love her. Not in any way I could name. Yet looking back now with clearer eyes, I know better.

### * * *

Devi’s room had begun to feel tighter, the air heavy with the smell of ink and hot iron. Her makeshift library loomed around us. Stacks of ragged, half-stitched books leaned drunkenly against one another, resembling a forgotten city wall. In the past, their roughness bothered me. The bare spines and uneven stitching quietly offended the elegance of knowledge. Over time, though, I began to see them differently. They were not relics to be admired, but tools meant for use.

I ran my hand over one of the stacks as I passed, my fingers catching on the threadbare stitching. Each page felt liminal somehow, ready to become more but still just shy of completeness. Maybe that’s why I found it so easy to scribble and scrawl everywhere, circling words, underlining passages, and folding corners. Perfect knowledge demands reverence. Yet these books felt more like conspirators. I never hesitated to use them ruthlessly.

On one such night, restless from the threads of our work, I leafed through a copy we had pulled from the Archives just days before. The document was thin and unassuming, with copied letters that were uneven in places and looked like the shadow of a poor man. Still, something in its contents caught the edge of my thoughts.

At first it seemed to be a list of common superstitions. There were things like “lights blue as flame,” “shadows moving unnaturally,” and “a grin too wide to be human.” Yet as I looked deeper and the contents became stranger and more tangled, I found things that stood out even more. I saw entries such as “a shattered wheel,” “a broken song,” and “a scar of iron.”  

I doubted their accuracy. Still, the thread was impossible not to follow. It led me into an unfamiliar corner of the Archives, a particularly dim and dusty section I had little cause to visit before. There, nestled between volumes on agricultural charms and burial rites, I found the book.

Black leather, cracked with age. The edges crumbled like old pastry as I slid it from the shelf, and I held my breath as the spine groaned in protest. Lighting my thief’s lamp, I opened the cover gingerly, savoring the musty fragrance of ancient parchment. The title greeted me in fading Temic, “En Temerant Voistra.”

My pulse quickened as I began to read. Most of the text was indecipherable, a ravaged artifact of time and translation. Yet a certain words leapt out, sharp as flint against the dark void of my ignorance.

> “Chandrian.”  

My hands trembled as I hunched over the tome. This was proof, neither censored nor hidden behind the Four-Plated Door. It had been here all along, waiting to be uncovered. I skimmed as quickly as I dared, although the fragile pages resisted my eagerness. The passages spoke of things I did not yet understand, such as enigmatic connections, places, and people.

Then, movement caught my eye at the edge of my vision. At the next desk, a student was bent over a stack of pages. At first, I thought nothing of it. There is an efficiency to solitude in the Archives, and you learn to ignore its other occupants. Still, something tugged at my attention.

His hands glided over the manuscript as if searching for meaning. Then I saw the stitching. It was crooked and uneven, with ragged, naked spines. They were my spines. My stomach twisted, sharp and sudden. Devi had sold the copy.

For a moment, I hesitated, lungs pulling shallow breaths as my options narrowed sharply in the still air. Confrontation was dangerous in the Archives because Lorren's rules were absolute. This manuscript, which belonged to us, was also dangerous in ways no one else had yet understood.

I forced my breath to steady. “Excuse me,” I said as I stepped closer. I kept my voice bright and light, using the friendly tone I had perfected over years of winning favors even when I had no right to ask for them.

The student startled, glancing up like a cornered hare. His face was thin, pale under the faint glow of the thief's lamp on my belt. “What?” he managed, guarded but not wary enough.

"Fascinating piece you’ve got there," I said easily. "Where did you find those loose manuscripts? I’ve been trying to track down something nearly identical."

His hand instinctively tightened over the edges of the parchment. “It’s for study,” he said, sounding evasive. “I found it at a merchant’s stall down in Imre.”

“Ah, Imre,” I replied with a conspirator’s confidence, slipping into another well-worn role. “One of the undermerchants, I’d wager?” I leaned casually against the desk, as if it were mere curiosity driving me to linger. “Had to be. The proper stalls would never deal in something so rare.”

The flattery worked. He eased slightly and lifted the corner of the page, allowing me to catch a better glimpse. “Yes, I suppose so. It cost more than I would have liked,” he admitted.

“But worth every coin, clearly,” I said quickly, nudging past his faint hesitation. I lowered my voice to a reverent hush, using a trick I’d learned long ago while convincing shopkeepers to bring out their best wares. “Tell me, would you mind if I took a look for just a moment? I promise I’ll be careful.”

His expression wavered as the instinct to protect faded beneath the weight of my practiced charm. He said, “I don’t,” then hesitated and finally loosened his grip on the manuscript. “Just for a moment.”

 My fingers brushed the edge of the parchment as I reached for it, careful to let my touch seem light and deferential. As soon as it passed into my hands, my stance straightened. I transformed into someone confident and unyielding as stone.

“Thank you,” I said, my gratitude genuine. “You’ve done the University a great service.” The words carried enough ambiguity to blur their meaning, and I didn’t wait for him to realize just how carefully I’d chosen them.

Without another word, I turned sharply on my heel, the manuscript held close to my chest, and made my way out of the Archives before he could voice his confusion or protest. If he dared report me, he’d find himself in the same precarious trouble as I.

By the time the great brass door of the Archives swung shut behind me, my knuckles ached from the strength of my grip, and my fury at Devi burned hotter than ever.

### * * *  

The cobblestones of Imre echoed under my boots as I approached Devi’s shop. Each step carried me closer to a confrontation I hadn’t yet planned but burned to have. I was brimming with rage, anger so thick it coiled in my gut like an angry snake about to strike. But as I neared her door, I stopped short.

Devi stood in the street, barefoot and furious, her hands loose at her sides. Her silhouette cut sharply against the dim light spilling from the streetlamp. Even without seeing her face, I knew something in her had come unmoored. But she wasn’t alone.

Across from her stood Master Lorren. His calm facade shattered, his usual measured grace replaced by raw force and single-minded purpose. He was nothing like the Lorren I had ever seen. Backlit by a dim streetlamp, his stance was broad, his arms raised like steel girders.

Devi stood opposite him, barefoot and wild-eyed, her disheveled frame seemingly untouched by the late hour or the tension that hung between them. Her grin was jagged as a splintered mirror, as though rage and triumph had struck her simultaneously.

Lorren’s voice rang out, sharp as breaking ice. “Enough, Devi. This is your last chance to end this peacefully.”

Her laugh was cutting, high and brittle. “Peacefully?” she echoed, her tone dripping venom. “Spare me. I know how this ends. You don’t care about peace. You care about control.”

For the first time, Lorren faltered. The change was nearly imperceptible, yet it felt unsettlingly real. His Alar, an invisible tide pressing outward, stuttered for a moment. Devi seized the opportunity with her own Alar surging forward. The air seemed to ripple and visibly distort for the briefest moment, as if the two forces were tearing the world apart between them.

“I won’t be held,” Devi hissed, her voice raw with something that sounded almost like despair. “Not by you! Not by any Master! Never again!”

Her will lashed out like a whip, forcing Lorren to drop into a defensive stance. His breaths grew heavier, and frost formed in his exhalations. Even as she pressed him, I could still see it. Lorren was not fighting to win; he was fighting to contain her. The difference showed in every strained line of his face.

It was her wild defiance against his measured inevitability. And she was winning.

“Devi!” I called out, my voice breaking the silence of the knife-edged conflict.

She turned, her Alar briefly brushing against mine. The force of it was staggering, a wave that nearly sent me reeling. I caught myself, reaching deep into the space between us with my own threads of intent. Barriers. Shields. Anything to stand against her.

“Stop this.” My voice was hoarse, robbed of its deeper confidence. “This isn’t what you want.”

Her smile twisted into something between pity and scorn. “Kvothe,” she said, her voice dripping acid. “You don’t know what I want!”

Her Alar surged, grinding against mine like iron against flint. My head pounded as the binder’s chill crept deeper, turning my limbs heavy with frost. Across from us, Lorren rose to his full height, determination etched into his pale, dampened face. Together, with our forces combined, Devi began to stumble.

I don’t know how long it lasted. The three of us remained locked in that silent, suffocating fight. In that place, time ceased to matter. Piece by piece, Devi’s strength faltered, though not because of anything we did. She simply spent herself, burning too brightly for too long.

When she fell, it was as though someone had cut her strings. She crumpled to the cobblestones, her chest rising and falling shallowly as strands of hair clung to her sweat-slicked face.

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. The chill in my veins spread faster now, turning each heartbeat into a slow, painful echo as darkness pulled at the edges of my vision. In the corner of my eye, I saw guards assembled, their presence both reassuring and ominous.

And then, all at once, the blackness took me.
