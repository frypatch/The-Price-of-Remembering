# CHAPTER 49

## TO ASH ALL THINGS RETURN  

CINDER APPEARED, ONE step from the doorway, his dull grey sword in hand. His lips curled into an eerie half-smile, more wolf than man.  

"There you are, little rabbit," he said softly, voice as cold and thin as frost. "It’s time you joined your parents."  

I stood across the room, calm on the surface but raw beneath—anger, fear, and something sharper all tangled in my chest. My fingers brushed the scarred grain of the bar as I replied, the words coming with a steady precision. "Not yet," I said, voice laced with a taunting edge. "I've still something to show you."  

Cinder tilted his head, pale locks catching the ebbing firelight, his dark, sunken eyes narrowing. "Such cowardice. If you won’t come to me," he said, mockingly quiet, "then I shall come to you."  

He took a step forward—and stopped. An invisible ripple flared in the dim firelight, faint as a needlepoint shimmer. He lifted his hand, pressing to the empty air before him as though feeling for an invisible wall. His fingers met resistance.  

"What is this?" His brow furrowed, and with a flick, his sword cut a silent arc. It struck the air, not stone nor wood, yet the same ripple flexed beneath his blade. Annoyance flickered in his face, twisting his mouth into a sneer. "What trickery is this?"  

With steady hands, I traced the rough stones of the pillar beside me. "Did I mention I built this place?" My voice carried a soft, sharp note, calculated and calm. The distortion before him flexed again as Cinder pushed against it, his thin smile returning with brittle anger. He didn’t answer, but his sword drifted back, readying.  

"Each and every stone," I continued. "Dragged them all here myself. Set them down. Made sure they fit. All for a purpose." I began to circle the room slowly, my hand brushing across the timber beams until I stopped near the hearth. "Do you want to know why I named it the Waystone?"  

Cinder stood still now, watching me, a snake uncoiled, waiting.  

"I thought you might." I tilted my head at him sharply, then whispered the name of stone. It wasn’t shouted or spat, but rather hummed through my teeth, a reminder, a command.  

The whole room answered. The walls groaned loud and deep, the sound rolling over us like the harrowing first note of some dreadful symphony. The inn trembled to its bones, bits of dust and stone flaking loose from cracks and crevices.  

Cinder staggered, eyes darting to the rafters above as the wood let out an aching wail. "You fool," he hissed, his voice tight with mockery and alarm, all the amusement gone. "You’d crush us both."  

"Perhaps I would," I said, "but not before I make my point."  

I spoke the name again, with more weight, more surety. The inn shuddered. A support beam behind Cinder cracked violently, wood splintering with deafening finality. Bottles and jars rattled loose from their shelves, tinkling to the floor. Another thunderous crash—louder this time—echoed from above as dust filled the air.  

I moved quickly, making for the cellar hatch. A single grunt of effort and the heavy iron batten slid free, falling to the floor with an accusing clang. I grabbed the edge and bolted up the stairs, throwing the hatch shut behind me.  

"I’ll see you outside," I said, though I knew he wouldn't hear me over the groaning weight of the failing inn.  

### * * *  

The wall of the Waystone didn’t just fall; it erupted outward in a violent spray of timber and stone. The force rattled through the ground as a figure emerged through the chaos. Cinder pushed into the open air like a predator passing through the brush, unhurried yet lethal.  

He swept away the haze of drifting debris with a single motion of his hand. As the mist of stone dust cleared around him, his expression shifted. His gaze lifted to the scene waiting beyond, and the breath that followed was sharp—not with fear, but with surprise.  

The Fae stretched out before him in strange, otherworldly magnificence: rolling hills covered in vibrant blue blossoms rippling without wind, their petals glittering like the soft shimmer of stars. Above, the sky burned deep purple, a rich, impossible hue dappled with streaks of gold flaring like distant comets. Butterflies too large and too bright drifted lazily through the air, their translucent wings trailing ribbons of light.  

"You brought me here," Cinder said, his words inflected with astonished disdain. "This was your plan?"  

"Not a plan," I replied evenly, stepping forward across the perfect grass. "A reckoning. For Trebon, for my parents, for everything in Renere." My voice sharpened. "For the crimes you’ve committed. This is the only fitting place for you to die."  

Cinder smiled, the grin twisting across his charred and weary face like the edge of a rusted blade. "You think this changes anything? Twice you’ve failed to kill me, and twice I’ve spared you." His grip on his sword shifted. "No more sparing, little rabbit."  

I advanced with deliberate steps, speaking softly. "Have you not heard? Third time pays for all."  

At the final word, I snapped my hand up, my fingers framing the air. The wind answered first, rushing in a wild surge and lifting me sharply from the ground. My feet hovered above the earth, the wind making a banner of my hair, copper-red streaks blazing against the violet sky. I shaped my hands. I called the ground, and it answered.  

The hills beneath me trembled as chunks of stone, some no larger than a fist, others as wide as carts, tore from the earth. They rose, glittering faintly with veins of iron, encircling me as though caught in some celestial orbit. Cinder watched me, his expression unreadable, but his blade tilted down, and he moved.  

The first shard of stone shot forward, hissing through the air with a scream sharp enough to cut the silence. Cinder darted sideways, silent and unnaturally fast, and the shard struck the ground with explosive force, dirt and earth spraying upward in plumes.  

I didn’t stop. Stone upon stone shot toward him, and Cinder spun between them with impossible grace, a wraith in the grass. One caught him, the edge shearing into his shoulder, stumbling his next step. Blood darkened his coat, but he kept moving.  

He closed the distance faster than I expected, so I spoke again. The wind surged once more, but this time differently: a roaring vortex that tore the ribbons of the strange Fae flowers into its current. The gale slammed into Cinder, halting him mid-step. He fell back, bracing himself and driving his sword deep into the ground to hold his footing.  

The tempest consumed him. Its fury wrapped around him. Only then did I call the fire.  

With a whisper of my own blood, the flames surged upward from the grass. The inferno snaked through the vortex, wrapping into the wild churn of wind, forming a column of fire and motion. It engulfed him, and for the first time, I heard Cinder scream.  

Still, he endured.  

When the flames faltered, my breath came hard. I lowered myself to the ground, knees trembling. The ash and smoke churned, whirling together in shapes barely discernible. In the chaos, there was movement.  

"It can’t be," I muttered under my breath, disbelief bitter on my tongue.  

From the smoke, Cinder stumbled forth, his flesh scorched raw, his clothing no more than hanging scraps. His eyes still burned—if not his fire, then some hollow will that kept him upright. He grinned, teeth blackened by the ruin of his face. "Come, little rabbit," he rasped, broken but still mocking.  

### * * *

I sank into the Ketan, every ounce of will sharpening to a point. *Folly’s* grey-white blade cut through the heavy forest air as I faced Cinder. His ruined body betrayed the savagery beneath: one shoulder hung low, blood streaked his pale, raw skin, but his black eyes burned as sharp as ever.  

“You’ve run far,” he said, voice smooth and bitter. “But all rabbits tire eventually.”  

I let my reply come with the blade. Climbing Iron sent *Folly* carving toward his chest, but Cinder was faster than he had any right to be, deflecting it with fluid ease. I pressed forward, flowing from one form to the next—*Iron*, *Crossing the River*, *Breaking Oak*. Each motion came with ferocity and discipline, but always, *Folly* found only steel.  

Then, in Maiden Dancing, the tide turned. I spun low, *Folly* arcing upward. Her edge sliced deep into his shoulder, carving muscle and bone. Cinder staggered, his feral scream echoing through the night.  

But his anger made him stronger. He came at me with sudden, blinding speed. His attacks rained down, heavy and precise, each strike a step closer to death. I tried for Chasing Stone, but he slipped through my guard. His blade bit deep into my right bicep, piercing through muscle. Pain tore through me, white-hot and overwhelming.  

Focusing became impossible. My sword arm trembled, and my strength waned. Cinder saw it, and he smiled.  

I couldn’t fight him—not here, not like this. Survival was my only choice.  

I turned and fled, forcing my legs to carry me through the dense, alien forest. Thorned brambles ripped at my sides. Roots tripped and clawed. Behind me, I could hear Cinder crashing through the undergrowth, relentless, closer with every step.  

“Run, little rabbit!” he called, his laughter as sharp as ice.  

The forest deepened. Thick-trunked trees spiraled into the sky, their bark glimmering faintly in the pale blue starlight above. These were not the Fae woods I’d visited before—this place was older, colder, stranger.  

When I burrowed to the edge of my resolve, I stopped. My hands worked quickly, pulling the *shaed* around me, wrapping me in darkness. The forest swallowed me. I crouched low, hidden, silent, waiting.  

Cinder stumbled into the clearing. His breath came ragged; his blood-slicked blade hung loose at his side. He scanned the shadows, his voice cutting through the silence. “Rabbit, where are you?”  

The wind answered for me. A single whispered word: “Ferula.”  

Cinder froze at the sound. His head turned sharply, searching.  

“Ferula,” I murmured again, letting the breeze carry the sound further.  

He snarled, spinning toward the whisper, teeth grinding together. “Face me!”  

The final *Ferula* whispered past him, curling faintly at the edge of his hearing. Enraged, he thrust his sword into the ground and spoke a binding word of his own. Light erupted again, sharp and harsh, flaring pale and unnatural. Bark glowed ghost-white; shadows stretched long.  

But his light did not drive the darkness away. Instead, it summoned something.  

The ground trembled faintly beneath us, and the air shifted—heavy, alive, expectant. A sound followed: soft, uneven, like velvet dragged across a splintered floor. Then came the light. Pale and bluish-white, it seared through the glade.  

Cinder staggered back, throwing an arm instinctively over his eyes. Above him, something vast began to shift, its edges sliding unnaturally into view.  

It was like flesh—not flesh like ours but something pliant and pale, stretched and uneven. It moved as though underwater, its bulk overwhelming the senses. And at its center, a subtle yawning—a mouth?—began to open. A cold, hollow sigh filled the space between stars and trees.  

Cinder trembled. His defiance broke apart, and raw fear tore through his voice. He screamed, falling to his knees as the light grew brighter. The thing above him pulsed again, a final draw of breath, and something bright and vital was pulled from him. That dreadful sigh echoed once more, and with it, the creature folded back into the nothingness from which it came.  

The air fell still.  

Only when I was sure the creature above had gone did I emerge, Folly balanced in ready hands. Cinder remained crumpled on the ground where the light had abandoned him. His face was broken in every way possible, his coal-black eyes empty of whatever fire had kept him going. He moaned softly, incoherent and hollow.  

As I approached, he lifted his hands toward me, trembling. Almost… seeking help.  

I paused, watching him. The Cthaeh’s words echoed unbidden in my mind: *Your father begged before the end*.  

This was not mercy I felt. It was resolve.  

I stepped closer and, without a word, brought *Folly* down. The blade severed his hands cleanly at the wrist. Blood pooled around him as his shattered form collapsed further into the dirt.
