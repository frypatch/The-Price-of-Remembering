# CHAPTER 49.

## TO ASH ALL THINGS RETURN.


KVOTHE TURNED FROM the open chest, golden light still settling into him like honey soaking into bread, warming him from within. Cinder stood at the foot of the stairs, his sword hanging loose in his hand, dull grey as old bones. His smile belonged to something that had never been human.  

“There you are, little rabbit,” he said. The words carried the gentle cruelty of frost killing flowers, sweet and terrible and patient. “Hiding in your burrow at last?”  

The cellar held its familiar silence, the kind that swallowed sound before it could be born. The small forge glowed faintly in the corner, coals whispering orange secrets to the darkness. Tools lay scattered across the workbench where Kvothe had abandoned them, tongs still tipped with soot, the copper chisel gone green with neglect. The acid stain on the floor had deepened since morning, eating its patient way into stone with a soft, steady hiss. Amid all this abandonment, two small cubes of blackened metal sat on the floor, one to either side of the doorway’s base, humming with a note too low to hear, too deep to ignore.  

“Not hiding,” Kvothe said. His voice carried the careful precision of a man setting pieces on a tak board. “Waiting.”  

Cinder tilted his head, and his white hair caught what little light remained like frost on dead grass. His dark eyes found the open chest, narrowed to slits. “Ah. Your little box of tricks. Did you think that would save you? Such faith in old magic.” His smile widened. “Your parents had faith too, in the end.”  

The words struck like cold wind finding an old scar. Kvothe’s hand tightened on the edge of the chest, knuckles white for a heartbeat before he forced them to relax. “You taught me that the best moves are made three turns in advance.” His fingers traced the wood again, deliberate as a player counting captured stones. “Beautiful games require patience.”  

Something flickered in Cinder’s black eyes. Recognition, perhaps. Or appreciation for a student who had learned his lessons well.  

He took a step forward.  

And stopped.  

The air shimmered. It was nothing at first, less than nothing, just the faintest suggestion that something was wrong with the space between them. Cinder’s next step met resistance where there should have been only empty air. His foot pressed against nothing, and nothing pressed back.  

“What is this?” The question came out wrong, twisted by confusion and the first stirrings of anger. His sword cut a vicious arc through the air. It struck nothing, yet the shimmer flexed and rippled like water disturbed by stones. The two cubes on the floor sang their silent song, and the barrier held.  

“A flat stone.” Kvothe’s voice carried quiet satisfaction, like a player revealing a trap set turns ago. “You taught me their value yourself. Control the board before you attack.”  

Cinder tested the barrier again, pressing harder this time. The air between them buckled slightly but held firm, curving up and over Kvothe in a perfect dome. “You think this will save you? I have time, little rabbit. All the time in the world.”  

“But I don’t.” Kvothe moved slowly along the wall, fingers trailing across the stones with the familiarity of a player counting his remaining pieces. “So I’ll have to make this quick. Tell me, do you remember what you said about the endgame? How the board itself can become a piece?”  

The Chandrian’s eyes narrowed. Something in Kvothe’s tone had changed. Something in his posture. He stood straighter now, and the golden light from the chest seemed to linger in his eyes.  

“Every stone in this inn is a waystone,” Kvothe continued, his hand pressing flat against the wall. “Every. Single. One. I’ve been setting this board since the day I arrived, moving pieces you couldn’t even see.”  

Understanding dawned in Cinder’s black eyes, followed immediately by alarm. The game was deeper than he’d imagined. The student had learned to play on levels the master hadn’t taught.  

“In tak, as you taught me,” Kvothe’s smile was thin and terrible, “sometimes the most beautiful move is to flip the entire board.”  

Cinder turned toward the stairs, but Kvothe had already begun to speak. Not shout. Not command. He spoke the name the way wind speaks through ancient stones, soft and certain and older than memory.  

“Cyaerbasalien.”  

The inn answered.  

The standing stones that ringed the cellar began to shift. They had stood like sleeping giants in the earth around them, tall and patient, bearing the weight of timber and tile and time. Now they remembered. The tremor started low, a vibration felt more than heard, then grew into something vast and terrible. The waystones began to dance.  

The inn shook like a ship in a storm. Dust cascaded from the ceiling. Tools jumped from the workbench, clattering across the floor. The acid hissed louder as its container tipped and spilled. Above them came the sound of timber groaning, of nails shrieking as they pulled free from wood, of glass shattering in every window at once.  

“You fool!” Cinder spun back to face him, real fear in his voice now. “You’ll bring it all down!”  

“Yes.” Kvothe’s voice held calm satisfaction as he watched the ceiling crack and splinter. The game was already won. All that remained was for the pieces to finish falling.  

Cinder spun, seeking escape, but the stairs were gone. Not collapsed. Gone. The waystones that had supported them now stood like monoliths, like ancient teeth, and between them yawned spaces full of that alien light.  

“What have you done?” The words tore from Cinder’s throat as timber crashed down around him. A beam caught his shoulder, spinning him sideways. Shattered glass opened red lines across his face.  

Kvothe looked up through his protective dome as the ceiling gave way completely. Floorboards splintered. Joists cracked like thunder. The weight of three stories came crashing down, and in that moment, in that breath between disaster and death, the waystones sang their loudest note.  

The world blinked.  

One instant Kvothe saw splintering wood and falling stone rushing toward them, heard the tremendous roar of the inn’s death, felt the weight pressing against his protective dome.  

The next instant, silence.  

Not true silence, but the soft, breathing quiet of the Fae. Above him stretched a sky that had forgotten what blue meant, settling instead for deep violet shot through with veins of gold. The terrible crash of the collapsing inn became a distant echo, muffled as if heard through deep water, then gone entirely.  

They stood in the Fae. The waystones remained, forming a rough circle around them, a primitive amphitheater of ancient stone. They rose perhaps ten feet, their tops jagged, existing here as they existed there, doors that were always doors no matter which side you stood on. Nothing else had come through. No debris. No broken bottles. No splintered wood. Only stone and flesh had made the crossing.  

Cinder stood at the circle’s edge, and the moments before transition had marked him. Blood painted abstract patterns down his face where glass had cut deep. His fine clothes hung in tatters where timber had torn fabric and flesh alike. The splinter of wood still jutted from his thigh. He pulled it free without flinching, though the blood that followed was very red, very real.  

The protective dome around Kvothe flickered and died as the two cubes exhausted their purpose, their song ending in a whisper. He rose slowly, legs trembling but steady.  

“You brought us here,” Cinder said, understanding dawning in his black eyes. “This was always your plan.”  

The Fae stretched beyond the waystone circle in impossible beauty. Hills rolled away covered in grass that had never bent before wind, only before will. Flowers bloomed in colors that mortal eyes shouldn’t see, their petals catching light that came from nowhere and everywhere at once. Butterflies with wings of crystallized moonlight drifted past, leaving trails of luminescence that lingered in the air like the memory of music.  

“Not a plan.” Kvothe stepped over the broken remains of his bar, past the shattered pieces of his life as an innkeeper. Each step took him further from Kote and closer to himself. “A reckoning. For Trebon. For my parents. For everything you took in Renere.” His voice gained edges with each word, sharp enough to cut. “For crimes beyond counting. This is the only place fitting for you to die. Here, where the old laws still remember justice. Here, where nowhere is far enough to run.”  

Cinder’s smile returned, twisting across his face like a scar reopening. “You think this changes anything? Twice you’ve failed to kill me. Twice I’ve let you live.” His grip shifted on his sword, fingers finding their killing hold. “No more mercy, little rabbit.”  

Kvothe advanced with measured steps. His voice dropped to barely more than a whisper, but it carried clear as bells. “Haven’t you heard? Third time pays for all.”  

On the final word, his hand snapped upward, fingers framing empty air. The wind answered before he even called. It came rushing wild and joyous, lifting him from the earth as easily as a mother lifts a child. His feet left the ground, and his hair became a banner of copper and flame against the alien sky.  

He shaped his hands in patterns old as starlight. The ground heard and answered.  

The hills trembled like a drumhead struck. Stones tore themselves free from the earth, some small as fists, others wide as cart wheels. They rose glittering with veins of iron, circling him in slow orbits like planets around a red sun.  

Cinder watched with an expression that might have been appreciation. Then his blade tilted down, and he moved.  

The first stone shrieked through the air with a sound like tearing silk. Cinder flowed sideways, liquid and impossibly fast, and the stone struck the ground hard enough to leave a crater. Earth fountained upward in a spray of soil and grass.  

Kvothe didn’t pause. Stone after stone flew toward Cinder, who danced between them with inhuman grace. He was smoke. He was water. He was everything except where the stones wanted him to be.  

Then one caught him. Just the edge of it, sheering through his shoulder. Blood bloomed dark on his pale coat. He stumbled, just for a moment.  

It was enough.  

The wind rose to a scream. Kvothe shaped it into something that had never existed before, a vortex that grabbed the scattered petals of those impossible flowers and wove them into its fury. The gale struck Cinder like a giant’s fist, driving him backward. He stabbed his sword deep into the earth to anchor himself, but the wind was relentless, tearing at him with a thousand invisible hands.  

Into that maelstrom, Kvothe whispered a single drop of his own blood. Fire bloomed.  

The flames didn’t simply burn. They sang. They danced. They wrapped themselves around the wind and became something new, a column of fire and fury that reached toward the strange stars. It embraced Cinder with terrible intimacy.  

For the first time in memory beyond counting, Cinder screamed.  

Still he endured.  

When the flames finally guttered and died, Kvothe lowered himself to the ground. His legs trembled. His breath came in gasps. Through the smoke and ash, he saw movement.  

“It can’t be,” he whispered, and the words tasted of copper and defeat.  

Cinder stumbled forward from the smoke. His flesh was ruin, his clothing charred rags, but his eyes still burned with that terrible emptiness. He smiled, and his teeth were black with his own burned blood. “Come, little rabbit,” he rasped through a throat torn raw by screaming. “Come and finish what you started.”  

Kvothe fell into the Ketan as naturally as water finds its level. Folly sang as she cleared her sheath, the grey-white blade catching colors that existed only in this strange place. Every muscle remembered its purpose. Every breath came measured and precise.  

Cinder should have been slow. Should have been weak. His body was a map of burns and wounds, one shoulder hanging wrong, blood painting abstract patterns on what remained of his skin.  

He was neither slow nor weak.  

“You’ve run far,” Cinder said, and his voice was smoke and honey and poison all at once. “But all rabbits tire eventually.”  

Kvothe let Folly answer. Climbing Iron carried the blade toward Cinder’s heart, but the Chandrian moved like water around stone, deflecting with lazy grace. Thunder Upward followed, then Crossing the River, then Heron Falling. Each form flowed into the next, a dance written in steel and intention, but always Cinder was elsewhere, always his blade turned Folly aside.  

Then came Maiden Dancing.  

Kvothe spun low, and Folly drew a perfect arc upward. The blade found flesh, biting deep into muscle and scraping against bone. Cinder’s scream echoed through the impossible forest, sending those strange butterflies scattering like scattered stars.  

Rage made him faster. Rage made him stronger.  

His attacks fell like rain, heavy and precise, each strike a promise of death barely turned aside. Kvothe tried for Chasing Stone, but Cinder slipped through his guard like smoke through fingers. The grey blade punched through muscle, piercing his right bicep completely. Pain exploded white-hot behind Kvothe’s eyes.  

His sword arm trembled. Strength fled like water from a broken jar.  

Cinder saw it. Cinder smiled.  

There was no more fighting to be done here. Only survival.  

Kvothe turned and ran. His legs carried him through the alien forest, past trees whose bark glimmered like wet ink, through thorns that sang as they tore his clothes. Behind him came Cinder, crashing through the undergrowth with the patience of winter, with the certainty of death.  

“Run, little rabbit!” The laughter was sharp as ice breaking. “Run and know that I follow!”  

The forest deepened. Trees spiraled toward a sky that had forgotten what color meant, their trunks thick as houses, their roots writhing like serpents frozen mid-strike. This was not the Fae he remembered. This was older. Colder. Strange in ways that made his teeth ache.  

When he could run no more, when his legs trembled and his breath came in knives, Kvothe stopped. His hands found the shaed and pulled it around himself. Darkness embraced him like an old friend. The forest swallowed him whole.  

Cinder stumbled into the clearing moments later. Blood made him clumsy. Rage made him careless. His blade hung loose at his side, and his breath came in ragged gasps. “Where are you, rabbit? Where do you hide?”  

The wind carried a whisper. “Ferula.”  

Cinder’s head snapped toward the sound, teeth bared.  

“Ferula,” came again from another direction entirely.  

He snarled, spinning toward the new sound, sword raised.  

The final “Ferula” brushed past him soft as a lover’s breath, close enough to stir his hair.  

“Face me!” The roar shook leaves from the trees.  

In his rage, Cinder spoke his own word of binding. Light erupted harsh and wrong, turning bark to bone, casting shadows that fell the wrong direction. It was the light of things that should not be seen, of moments that should not be remembered.  

But light calls to its opposite, and in this old place, in this deep forest, something answered.  

The ground trembled. Not with violence, but with recognition. The air grew heavy, expectant, like the moment before lightning strikes. A sound came from everywhere and nowhere, soft and terrible, like velvet dragged across broken glass.  

Then came the light.  

Pale and blue-white, it seared through the glade with the intensity of a star being born. Cinder threw an arm across his eyes, staggering backward.  

Above him, something vast began to unfold.  

It was flesh but not flesh. It moved like something underwater, like something dreaming, like something that had never been born and so could never die. At its center, a mouth that was not a mouth began to open. A cold hollow sigh filled the space between heartbeats.  

Cinder fell to his knees. Terror replaced rage, fear so pure it seemed to shine from him like light. He screamed, but the sound was lost in that terrible sighing.  

The thing above pulsed once, and something bright and vital was pulled from Cinder’s chest. The sigh came again, satisfied, and the creature folded back into the nothing from which it came.  

The air fell still. The forest held its breath.  

Only when silence had settled like dust did Kvothe emerge from the shadows. Folly balanced in his hands, ready, waiting.  

Cinder knelt in the dirt, broken in ways that had nothing to do with flesh. His coal-black eyes were empty windows. He moaned, wordless and lost.  

When Kvothe approached, Cinder lifted his hands. They trembled like leaves in autumn, reaching, seeking. Almost pleading.  

The Cthaeh’s words echoed unbidden in memory. Your father begged before the end.  

This was not mercy Kvothe felt. It was completion.  

He stepped forward, and Folly sang through the air. The blade took Cinder’s hands cleanly at the wrists. They fell like strange fruit to the forest floor, and blood pooled dark as old secrets around them.  

Cinder collapsed forward into the dirt, into his own spreading blood, into an ending that had been written in the stars before the world was made.  

Kvothe stood over him for a long moment, watching as the last of what had been Cinder leaked away into the hungry earth. The strange butterflies returned, settling on the cooling corpse with wings that whispered of light and loss.  

Finally, Kvothe cleaned Folly on the grass that grew greener where Cinder’s blood had fallen. He turned his back on what remained and walked deeper into the forest, following a path that only he could see, toward whatever waited beyond the next turn of the story.  

The Fae watched him go, patient as stone, old as silence, keeping its secrets for another day.
