# CHAPTER 49.

## TO ASH ALL THINGS RETURN.


KVOTHE TURNED FROM the open chest, its golden light still singing in his bones, to face the shadow at the foot of the stairs. Cinder descended the last steps into the cellar with the careful grace of a cat entering unfamiliar territory. His sword hung loose in his hand, dull grey as old bones, and his smile belonged to something that had never been human.  

“There you are, little rabbit,” he said. The words were soft as falling snow, cold as the spaces between stars. “Hiding in your burrow at last.”  

The cellar was a different kind of darkness than the inn above. Stone walls pressed close, remembering centuries of silence. Barrels lined the walls like sleeping giants, and the air tasted of earth and age and secrets kept too long. Between them, barely visible in the dim light, two small cubes of blackened metal sat innocuous on the floor, one to either side of the doorway’s base. They hummed with a note too low to hear, too deep to ignore.  

“Not hiding,” Kvothe said. His voice carried the careful precision of a man setting pieces on a tak board. “Waiting.”  

Cinder tilted his head, and his white hair caught what little light remained like frost on dead grass. His dark eyes found the open chest, narrowed to slits. “Ah. Your little box of tricks. Did you think that would save you?” The mockery in his voice was thin as paper, sharp as broken glass. “Such faith in old magic. Your parents had faith too, in the end.”  

He took a step forward.  

And stopped.  

The air shimmered. It was nothing at first, less than nothing, just the faintest suggestion that something was wrong with the space between them. Cinder’s next step met resistance where there should have been only empty air. His foot pressed against nothing, and nothing pressed back.  

“What is this?” The question came out wrong, twisted by confusion and the first stirrings of anger. His sword cut a vicious arc through the air. It struck nothing, yet the shimmer flexed and rippled like water disturbed by stones. The two cubes on the floor sang their silent song, and the barrier held.  

Kvothe’s hand found the rough stones of the cellar wall. Each stone knew his touch. Each one remembered. “Did I mention I built this place?” His voice was conversational, almost gentle. “Every single stone. I dragged them here myself. Set them in place. Made certain they fit perfectly.”  

“More tricks.” Cinder tested the barrier again, pressing harder this time. The air between them buckled slightly but held firm, curving up and over Kvothe in a perfect dome. “You think this will save you? I have time, little rabbit. All the time in the world.”  

“But I don’t.” Kvothe moved slowly along the wall, fingers trailing across the stones with the familiarity of a musician tuning his lute. “So I’ll have to make this quick. Do you know what waystones are, Cinder?”  

The Chandrian’s eyes narrowed. Something in Kvothe’s tone had changed. Something in his posture. He stood straighter now, and the golden light from the chest seemed to linger in his eyes.  

“Old stones,” Kvothe continued, not waiting for an answer. “Ancient stones. Stones that remember the shape of the world before it was broken.” His hand pressed flat against the wall, and beneath his palm, the stone seemed to pulse. “Every stone in this inn is a waystone. Every. Single. One. Would you like to know why I named it the Waystone Inn?”  

Understanding dawned in Cinder’s black eyes, followed immediately by alarm, but Kvothe had already begun to speak. Not shout. Not command. He spoke a name the way a mother speaks to a sleeping child, gentle and sure and absolutely certain it will be heard.  

The inn answered.  

It didn’t groan. It sang. Every stone in the building remembered what it was, remembered its purpose, remembered its name. The sound was deep as mountains dreaming, old as the first word ever spoken. The cellar ceiling began to bow inward, not cracking but flowing like water returning to the sea.  

“You fool!” Cinder spun back to face him, real fear in his voice now. “You’ll bury yourself!”  

“Yes.” Kvothe’s voice was calm as deep water, certain as stone. “But not alone.”  

He spoke the name again, louder now, and something unprecedented happened. The waystones didn’t break. They remembered. Every stone in the walls began to sing the same note, harmonizing with a frequency older than music, older than words. They remembered what they were before men carved them square and stacked them neat. They remembered being doors.  

Above them, the inn began to fall. Not the waystones. Never the waystones. But everything else. The timber screamed as it tore free from stone. Plaster cracked and crumbled. Glass shattered into glittering rain. The mortar between the waystones turned to dust and memory, leaving gaps that showed not darkness but something else entirely. Through those gaps came light that had never known the sun, purple-gold and pulsing like a heartbeat.  

Cinder spun, seeking escape, but the stairs were gone. Not collapsed. Gone. The waystones that had supported them now stood like monoliths, like ancient teeth, and between them yawned spaces full of that alien light.  

“What have you done?” The words tore from Cinder’s throat as timber crashed down around him. A beam caught his shoulder, spinning him sideways. Shattered glass opened red lines across his face.  

Kvothe looked up through his protective dome as the ceiling gave way completely. Floorboards splintered. Joists cracked like thunder. The weight of three stories came crashing down, and in that moment, in that breath between disaster and death, the waystones sang their loudest note.  

The world blinked.  

One instant Kvothe saw splintering wood and falling stone rushing toward them, heard the tremendous roar of the inn’s death, felt the weight pressing against his protective dome.  

The next instant, silence.  

Not true silence, but the soft, breathing quiet of the Fae. Above him stretched a sky that had forgotten what blue meant, settling instead for deep violet shot through with veins of gold. The terrible crash of the collapsing inn became a distant echo, muffled as if heard through deep water, then gone entirely.  

They stood in the Fae. The waystones remained, forming a rough circle around them, a primitive amphitheater of ancient stone. They rose perhaps ten feet, their tops jagged where they had torn free from the inn’s upper stories, existing here as they existed there, doors that were always doors no matter which side you stood on. Scattered throughout the circle lay the debris that had fallen through in that instant of transition. Broken bottles leaked their contents into soil that had never known wine. Splintered furniture lay scattered like the bones of wooden beasts. His ledger, somehow intact, its pages ruffling in a wind that smelled of dreams and distant starlight.  

Cinder stood at the circle’s edge, and the transition had not been kind to him. In that single moment of crossing, in that blink between worlds, the falling debris had found him. Blood painted abstract patterns down his face where glass had kissed skin. His fine clothes hung in tatters where timber had torn fabric and flesh alike. A splinter of wood the length of a man’s hand jutted from his thigh. He pulled it free without flinching, though the blood that followed was very red, very real.  

The protective dome around Kvothe flickered and died as the two cubes exhausted their purpose, their song ending in a whisper. He rose slowly, legs trembling but steady.  

“You brought us here,” Cinder said, understanding dawning in his black eyes. “This was always your plan.”  

The Fae stretched beyond the waystone circle in impossible beauty. Hills rolled away covered in grass that had never bent before wind, only before will. Flowers bloomed in colors that mortal eyes shouldn’t see, their petals catching light that came from nowhere and everywhere at once. Butterflies with wings of crystallized moonlight drifted past, leaving trails of luminescence that lingered in the air like the memory of music.  

“Not a plan.” Kvothe stepped over the broken remains of his bar, past the shattered pieces of his life as an innkeeper. Each step took him further from Kote and closer to himself. “A reckoning. For Trebon. For my parents. For everything you took in Renere.” His voice gained edges with each word, sharp enough to cut. “For crimes beyond counting. This is the only place fitting for you to die. Here, where the old laws still remember justice. Here, where nowhere is far enough to run.”  

Cinder’s smile returned, twisting across his face like a scar reopening. “You think this changes anything? Twice you’ve failed to kill me. Twice I’ve let you live.” His grip shifted on his sword, fingers finding their killing hold. “No more mercy, little rabbit.”  

Kvothe advanced with measured steps. His voice dropped to barely more than a whisper, but it carried clear as bells. “Haven’t you heard? Third time pays for all.”  

On the final word, his hand snapped upward, fingers framing empty air. The wind answered before he even called. It came rushing wild and joyous, lifting him from the earth as easily as a mother lifts a child. His feet left the ground, and his hair became a banner of copper and flame against the alien sky.  

He shaped his hands in patterns old as starlight. The ground heard and answered.  

The hills trembled like a drumhead struck. Stones tore themselves free from the earth, some small as fists, others wide as cart wheels. They rose glittering with veins of iron, circling him in slow orbits like planets around a red sun.  

Cinder watched with an expression that might have been appreciation. Then his blade tilted down, and he moved.  

The first stone shrieked through the air with a sound like tearing silk. Cinder flowed sideways, liquid and impossibly fast, and the stone struck the ground hard enough to leave a crater. Earth fountained upward in a spray of soil and grass.  

Kvothe didn’t pause. Stone after stone flew toward Cinder, who danced between them with inhuman grace. He was smoke. He was water. He was everything except where the stones wanted him to be.  

Then one caught him. Just the edge of it, sheering through his shoulder. Blood bloomed dark on his pale coat. He stumbled, just for a moment.  

It was enough.  

The wind rose to a scream. Kvothe shaped it into something that had never existed before, a vortex that grabbed the scattered petals of those impossible flowers and wove them into its fury. The gale struck Cinder like a giant’s fist, driving him backward. He stabbed his sword deep into the earth to anchor himself, but the wind was relentless, tearing at him with a thousand invisible hands.  

Into that maelstrom, Kvothe whispered a single drop of his own blood. Fire bloomed.  

The flames didn’t simply burn. They sang. They danced. They wrapped themselves around the wind and became something new, a column of fire and fury that reached toward the strange stars. It embraced Cinder with terrible intimacy.  

For the first time in memory beyond counting, Cinder screamed.  

Still he endured.  

When the flames finally guttered and died, Kvothe lowered himself to the ground. His legs trembled. His breath came in gasps. Through the smoke and ash, he saw movement.  

“It can’t be,” he whispered, and the words tasted of copper and defeat.  

Cinder stumbled forward from the smoke. His flesh was ruin, his clothing charred rags, but his eyes still burned with that terrible emptiness. He smiled, and his teeth were black with his own burned blood. “Come, little rabbit,” he rasped through a throat torn raw by screaming. “Come and finish what you started.”  

Kvothe fell into the Ketan as naturally as water finds its level. Folly sang as she cleared her sheath, the grey-white blade catching colors that existed only in this strange place. Every muscle remembered its purpose. Every breath came measured and precise.  

Cinder should have been slow. Should have been weak. His body was a map of burns and wounds, one shoulder hanging wrong, blood painting abstract patterns on what remained of his skin.  

He was neither slow nor weak.  

“You’ve run far,” Cinder said, and his voice was smoke and honey and poison all at once. “But all rabbits tire eventually.”  

Kvothe let Folly answer. Climbing Iron carried the blade toward Cinder’s heart, but the Chandrian moved like water around stone, deflecting with lazy grace. Thunder Upward followed, then Crossing the River, then Heron Falling. Each form flowed into the next, a dance written in steel and intention, but always Cinder was elsewhere, always his blade turned Folly aside.  

Then came Maiden Dancing.  

Kvothe spun low, and Folly drew a perfect arc upward. The blade found flesh, biting deep into muscle and scraping against bone. Cinder’s scream echoed through the impossible forest, sending those strange butterflies scattering like scattered stars.  

Rage made him faster. Rage made him stronger.  

His attacks fell like rain, heavy and precise, each strike a promise of death barely turned aside. Kvothe tried for Chasing Stone, but Cinder slipped through his guard like smoke through fingers. The grey blade punched through muscle, piercing his right bicep completely. Pain exploded white-hot behind Kvothe’s eyes.  

His sword arm trembled. Strength fled like water from a broken jar.  

Cinder saw it. Cinder smiled.  

There was no more fighting to be done here. Only survival.  

Kvothe turned and ran. His legs carried him through the alien forest, past trees whose bark glimmered like wet ink, through thorns that sang as they tore his clothes. Behind him came Cinder, crashing through the undergrowth with the patience of winter, with the certainty of death.  

“Run, little rabbit!” The laughter was sharp as ice breaking. “Run and know that I follow!”  

The forest deepened. Trees spiraled toward a sky that had forgotten what color meant, their trunks thick as houses, their roots writhing like serpents frozen mid-strike. This was not the Fae he remembered. This was older. Colder. Strange in ways that made his teeth ache.  

When he could run no more, when his legs trembled and his breath came in knives, Kvothe stopped. His hands found the shaed and pulled it around himself. Darkness embraced him like an old friend. The forest swallowed him whole.  

Cinder stumbled into the clearing moments later. Blood made him clumsy. Rage made him careless. His blade hung loose at his side, and his breath came in ragged gasps. “Where are you, rabbit? Where do you hide?”  

The wind carried a whisper. “Ferula.”  

Cinder’s head snapped toward the sound, teeth bared.  

“Ferula,” came again from another direction entirely.  

He snarled, spinning toward the new sound, sword raised.  

The final “Ferula” brushed past him soft as a lover’s breath, close enough to stir his hair.  

“Face me!” The roar shook leaves from the trees.  

In his rage, Cinder spoke his own word of binding. Light erupted harsh and wrong, turning bark to bone, casting shadows that fell the wrong direction. It was the light of things that should not be seen, of moments that should not be remembered.  

But light calls to its opposite, and in this old place, in this deep forest, something answered.  

The ground trembled. Not with violence, but with recognition. The air grew heavy, expectant, like the moment before lightning strikes. A sound came from everywhere and nowhere, soft and terrible, like velvet dragged across broken glass.  

Then came the light.  

Pale and blue-white, it seared through the glade with the intensity of a star being born. Cinder threw an arm across his eyes, staggering backward.  

Above him, something vast began to unfold.  

It was flesh but not flesh. It moved like something underwater, like something dreaming, like something that had never been born and so could never die. At its center, a mouth that was not a mouth began to open. A cold hollow sigh filled the space between heartbeats.  

Cinder fell to his knees. Terror replaced rage, fear so pure it seemed to shine from him like light. He screamed, but the sound was lost in that terrible sighing.  

The thing above pulsed once, and something bright and vital was pulled from Cinder’s chest. The sigh came again, satisfied, and the creature folded back into the nothing from which it came.  

The air fell still. The forest held its breath.  

Only when silence had settled like dust did Kvothe emerge from the shadows. Folly balanced in his hands, ready, waiting.  

Cinder knelt in the dirt, broken in ways that had nothing to do with flesh. His coal-black eyes were empty windows. He moaned, wordless and lost.  

When Kvothe approached, Cinder lifted his hands. They trembled like leaves in autumn, reaching, seeking. Almost pleading.  

The Cthaeh’s words echoed unbidden in memory. Your father begged before the end.  

This was not mercy Kvothe felt. It was completion.  

He stepped forward, and Folly sang through the air. The blade took Cinder’s hands cleanly at the wrists. They fell like strange fruit to the forest floor, and blood pooled dark as old secrets around them.  

Cinder collapsed forward into the dirt, into his own spreading blood, into an ending that had been written in the stars before the world was made.  

Kvothe stood over him for a long moment, watching as the last of what had been Cinder leaked away into the hungry earth. The strange butterflies returned, settling on the cooling corpse with wings that whispered of light and loss.  

Finally, Kvothe cleaned Folly on the grass that grew greener where Cinder’s blood had fallen. He turned his back on what remained and walked deeper into the forest, following a path that only he could see, toward whatever waited beyond the next turn of the story.  

The Fae watched him go, patient as stone, old as silence, keeping its secrets for another day.
