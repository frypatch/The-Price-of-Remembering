# EPILOGUE.

## THE LAST NAME SPOKEN.

THOUGH THE MORNING AIT bit cold against Pehyn’s throat, she held it in her lungs as if she could forge courage from that breath alone. Vashet had declared her ready, and Pehyn wished desperately to believe it. But what if the words failed her? She had practiced until her throat burned raw, repeating the Atas in darkness and in light, letting the names wear grooves in her memory. Still, Vashet’s words rang in her mind like hammer strikes. “Three days was all it took, once.” Pehyn had held her tongue, but heat had risen to her cheeks all the same.  

Her mother waited outside in grey so plain it seemed to reject ornament, as if she herself had been tempered down to only what was necessary, what was strong. Penthe’s hands rose in the gesture that needed no translation. *Are you ready?* Pehyn nodded, though the motion carried more weight than she expected, as if she were already bearing the blade whose history she would speak. Penthe tilted her chin in the barest acknowledgment and turned, leading her daughter through Haert’s ancient streets.  

The pathway beneath their feet had been worn smooth by countless ceremonies, each stone polished by the passage of those who had stood where Pehyn would stand. The morning sun climbed higher, casting shadows that shifted like the play of light on folded steel. Wind touched her hair, red as forge-fire, and for one brief moment she felt herself transformed into something harder, something that could bear the heat of what was coming.

At the steps, Pehyn stopped. The gathered crowd stood waiting, tempered by generations of such ceremonies, their faces showing the patient endurance of those who understood their part. The moment belonged to them all, a link in the chain of their history.  

She climbed and turned to face them. Every eye upon her, every breath held. She searched their faces for judgment and found something that struck deeper. Trust. For all her fear, this was her place to stand, her metal to shape.  

“First,” she began, her voice rough as an unfinished edge before it found its polish. “First came Chael.”  

The Atas began to flow from her, each name ringing clear as hammer meeting anvil. She no longer spoke the words but became the forge through which they passed, each syllable tempered by breath and will. Name after name emerged, each one folded into the next like steel being worked, layer upon layer, her fear thinning with each fold until the sword’s history stood nearly complete.  

When she reached the final name, her breath stilled like the pause before the quench.  

“Last came Kvothe.” The name left her lips quieter than the others, but it carried the weight of finished steel. “The one who reforged me for a great and noble purpose.”  

The crowd held their silence, letting the name settle into place like a blade finding its sheath. The word seemed to hang in the air between them, a bridge of sound connecting what was to what would be.

For a long moment, nothing moved. The silence grew dense with the weight of witnessed tradition. Pehyn stood at the top of the steps, her body light as if the speaking had burned away everything unnecessary, leaving only what was essential and strong. She looked out across the gathered faces and found recognition where she had expected judgment. She had become part of the sword’s story, another voice in its long telling.  

Penthe stepped forward as her daughter descended. Her hands moved with the precision of a master smith’s strike. *Well done.*  

The gesture struck Pehyn not as praise but as completion, the final hammer blow that sets the work. Her feet found solid ground. Her shadow no longer danced ahead of her but moved in perfect time with her steps, balanced at last.  

She followed her mother home through streets that seemed somehow different, though nothing had changed but her. The morning air still bit cold, but she carried warmth within her now, banked like coals that would burn steady through whatever came next. Behind them, the crowd began to disperse, but that final name still rang in the air like steel singing long after the hammer has been set aside.
