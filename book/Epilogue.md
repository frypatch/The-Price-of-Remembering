# EPILOGUE

## THE LAST NAME SPOKEN

PEHYN DREW A long breath, steadying herself. The morning air was sharp and cold, as if to remind her that the moment was real. Vashet had said she was ready, but doubt clung to her all the same. What if the words failed her? She’d practiced until her throat burned, repeating the Atas under her breath even in the dark of night. Still, Vashet’s teasing words rang in her head: “Three days was all it took, once.” Pehyn had said nothing, but her cheeks had flushed in quiet frustration.  

Her mother waited for her outside, wrapped in white, sharp-featured and steady as weathered stone. Penthe’s hands rose, asking a silent question: *Are you ready?* Pehyn nodded, though the motion felt heavier than she expected. Penthe tilted her chin in the barest approval and turned, leading her daughter through Haert’s winding streets.  

The pathway beneath their feet was ancient, pale stones smoothed with use. Shadows played across the old village walls as the sun broke higher. The breeze teased Pehyn’s hair, red as flame, and for a fleeting moment, she imagined herself something closer to courage.

At the steps, Pehyn stopped. The crowd had gathered, their faces drawn but expectant. This was no personal moment—it belonged to them all. The air seemed to hum with their silent presence.  

She climbed and turned to face them. Standing there, she suddenly felt the weight of their eyes. She searched them for judgment and found something far worse: trust. For all her fear, this was her place to stand, her duty to fulfill.  

“First,” she began, her voice unsteady, though it steadied as she spoke. “First came Chael.”  

The Atas began to flow, sharp and sure, until Pehyn no longer spoke but became its vessel. Name after name rang out, each one unfurling like steel tempered by fire. Her voice found its rhythm, her fear falling away, replaced by a quiet certainty. Through her, the blade’s history unfurled, its story sharp enough to cut silence itself.  

And yet, when she reached the end, her breath stilled.  

“Last…” Her voice caught, the final name heavier than the blade itself. The crowd seemed to lean forward with her.  

“Last came Kvothe,” she said, quieter now, but stronger. “The one who reforged me for a great and noble purpose.”  

The audience didn’t move. The name lingered in the air as if etched into the sky, a thread tied taut between past and present.  

### * * *

For a long beat, there was no sound. The silence felt alive, dense and full. Pehyn stood still at the top of the steps, her body light, as if unmoored from her fear. She looked out across the crowd and saw not judgment but unity, a shared story now as much hers as theirs.  

Penthe stepped forward as her daughter descended. Her hands moved with deliberate clarity: *Well done.*  

The words hit her not like praise, but like a tether. Grounding. Real. Pehyn’s shadow no longer danced ahead of her. It stood still, matching her stride as her mother turned and began the walk home.

Pehyn followed her mother home, her legs steady now, her shadow no longer dancing ahead but moving alongside her own.
