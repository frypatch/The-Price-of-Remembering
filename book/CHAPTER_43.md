# CHAPTER 43

## INTERLUDE

## OUT OF THE CHILL  

KOTE TRAILED OFF, his voice dwindling like a wick near its end. The quill in Chronicler’s hand hovered over the page, ink threatening to drop. The quiet in the Waystone Inn thickened, heavy as a sodden cloak. Chronicler shifted in his chair, uncomfortable, while Bast’s fingers fidgeted with the edge of his sleeve.  

Finally, Bast broke the silence, his voice soft. “Oh, Reshi. I never knew.”  

Kote didn’t look up. His jaw tightened, his gaze boring into the table as if it might collapse under the weight of everything unsaid. Then, at last, he rose. The scrape of his chair across the floor made them flinch.  

“It’s late,” he said, his voice too steady, too careful. “There are things I need to tend to before dark.” He managed a faint, brittle smile. “Eat something. We’ve more to get through tonight.” Without waiting for a reply, he turned and slipped through the kitchen flap, leaving the two men in uneasy stillness.

The night outside hit him like a bitter slap, the crisp autumn chill cutting through the heat still lingering on his skin. Kote stepped into the deep shadow behind the Waystone and let out a slow, shuddering breath. He walked to the rain barrel near the back wall and lowered himself against it, the old wood rough against his back. He let his head fall into his hands.  

The memories rose before he could stop them, cold as the air. Denna, her laugh like sunlight on water, her voice soft around his name. Then the shadows came—the regrets, the what-ifs. Each a stone, building weight in his chest. He tightened his hands against his scalp, but it didn’t help.  

The tears came quietly, stealing down his cheeks unchecked. It wasn’t something he could fight anymore—not tonight. He stayed like that, crumpled and silent, until something moved in the darkness.  

A faint rustling cut through the stillness. Kote froze, his breath catching. The years of a past life hummed in his blood: waiting, calculating. His eyes searched the shadows. Bare branches swayed faintly in the breeze, but there was no wind.  

Then a soft flutter. An owl shifted on a branch above, its feathers brushing against bark as it rose and resettled. Kote exhaled, forcing himself to breathe slowly, reclaiming his pulse. It was nothing. Only an owl.  

As he stood to leave, something caught his eye near the base of the wall—a color too bright for the dim light around him. A selas flower.  

Its crimson bloom faced the moon, fragile and undeniable. It shouldn’t have thrived here, not with the frost that edged the nights, but it had. Kote crouched, staring at it, his fingers hovering just shy of its delicate petals. It stirred a memory from long ago: distant laughter, a name on his lips.  

His voice broke the stillness, soft as breath. “We’ll be together again soon.”  

He rose, brushing his hands. The chill lingered on his skin, but he turned away from it, slipping back into the Waystone.  

Inside, the room was warm, but warmth was never enough.
