# CHAPTER 43.

## INTERLUDE.

## OUT OF THE CHILL.


KOTE’S VOICE SIMPLY stopped. Its absence was like a lute string that stops singing when a careless hand falls hard against the fretboard. Sudden and final and wrong. The kind of ending that makes everyone in a room look up from their drinks, wondering what has broken, wondering why the world sounds different now that the music has gone.  

The quill in Chronicler’s hand stilled against the page, the last word only half formed. The life drained from the Waystone Inn like water from a cracked bowl, leaving behind such a hollow that the walls seemed to lean inward and the ceiling to bow down, as if the room itself grieved. The kind of emptiness that makes you understand why some stories cost more to tell than anyone should have to pay.  

Bast’s fingers found the edge of his sleeve and worried at it, pulling loose a thread that had been waiting all day to unravel. Then his arms wrapped around his knees and he rocked back and forth, his gaze flickering to the rafters as if the ceiling might hold back what threatened to spill from his eyes. “Oh, Reshi,” he said, the words tumbling out before he could stop them. “I never knew.”  

Kote sat perfectly still, his hands flat against the table. He studied the wood grain as if it held answers, as if following those dark lines might lead him somewhere other than here. The muscles in his jaw worked once, twice, then stilled. When he stood, the chair scraped against the floor, the sound harsh in the grieving quiet.  

“It’s late,” he said, his voice coming out a little too steady, a little too careful. “There are things I need to tend to before dark.”  

A smile tried to find its way onto his face. It was the sort of smile that served as armor, the kind you wear when the alternative is letting the world see you shatter. “Eat something. We’ve more to get through tonight.”  

He turned toward the kitchen, and neither Bast nor Chronicler moved to stop him. Some exits are too necessary to interrupt. The door swung closed behind him with the soft certainty of a book being shut.  

### * * *

Kote moved through the kitchen without seeing it, his feet carrying him past the familiar stations of his daily work. The cutting board. The copper pots. The herbs hanging from their hooks. He pushed through the back door and into the night beyond, where autumn waited with teeth bared. The cold struck him like a slap, like a blessing, wrapping around him like water around a drowning man. Shocking and sudden and somehow exactly what he needed.  

He walked to the rain barrel that stood in the shadow of the inn’s back wall and gripped its edge, the old wood rough beneath his palms as he let his head hang forward. For a moment he stayed like that, braced against something solid and real in a way that nothing else seemed to be anymore. Then his knees gave way like they’d been waiting for permission, and he slid down to sit in the dirt with his back against the barrel.  

He pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes until he saw stars that weren’t stars, just the protest of a body pushed too far. But the memories came anyway. They always did.  

Denna’s voice, singing that terrible song that had torn the world open. The weight of her in his arms as they fled through the desert. The way her breathing had slowed and slowed and slowed until it simply stopped, like a clock winding down, like a story reaching its end, like everything that mattered finding its way to nothing.  

The tears came without ceremony or warning. They traced hot lines down his cold cheeks, and he let them fall. There was no one here to see. No one to judge the great Kvothe brought low by memory and regret. Just a man named Kote, sitting in the dirt behind an inn, learning again what it meant to grieve.  

A faint rustling cut through the quiet. Soft. Subtle. Wrong.  

Years of a past life stirred in his blood. His breath stilled and his eyes searched the treeline, waiting, calculating.  

The branches of the oak tree swayed, but there was no wind. Not even a breeze to excuse the movement.  

Then he saw it. A soft flutter. An owl shifted on a branch above, its feathers brushing against bark as it rose and resettled. Kote exhaled, forcing himself to breathe slowly, reclaiming his pulse. It was nothing. Only an owl.  

As he stood to leave, something caught his eye. A splash of color where color had no business being.  

There, growing beside the inn’s foundation despite the frost that silvered the ground each morning, despite the dying of the year, despite every reason it shouldn’t exist, bloomed a single selas flower.  

The crimson petals caught what little moonlight filtered through the clouds, holding it like cupped hands hold water. Precious. Temporary. Perfect.  

Kote crouched beside it, his fingers stopping just short of touching those impossibly delicate petals. The flower faced the moon with the quiet confidence of beautiful things that know they won’t last. It was the sort of flower a young man might have picked for a girl with dark hair and a crooked smile. The sort of flower that meant more than words could ever say. The sort of flower that bloomed in stories but rarely in life.  

“We’ll be together again soon.” The words escaped before he could stop them, soft as secrets, certain as sorrow.  

He stood and turned away from the flower, from the moon, from all the things that insisted on beauty in a world that had forgotten what beauty meant. The door of the Waystone welcomed him back to warmth that wasn’t quite warm enough, to light that wasn’t quite bright enough, to a life that wasn’t quite life enough.  

Behind him, the selas flower continued its impossible bloom, a small defiance against the coming winter. A promise, perhaps. Or maybe just a flower, doing what flowers do when no one’s watching.  

Inside, the silence waited for him, patient as always. It had learned to be.
