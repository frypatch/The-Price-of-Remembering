# CHAPTER 15

## MISSING  

FOR SOMEONE ON the run, I made a wretched fugitive. My legs buckled with every step, hollow and trembling under me. The plain rags from Haven clung to my skin, torn and wet, carrying the damp, sour tang of sweat and mildew. I should have planned better—I should have rested. But planning and resting would have meant thinking, and I was doing my best to avoid thinking.  

The streets of Imre bristled with danger. Every clatter of a wagon on cobblestones, every half-glimpsed shadow cast by flickering lantern light sent my heart leaping to my throat. The city felt sharp and alive, ready to cut me down for daring to walk openly. When an overhead shutter swung closed with a snap, I flinched violently, careening sideways like a spooked horse. It was absurd. A younger, wiser version of me would have laughed at how I'd become a mirror of the madmen I thought I’d escaped.  

Yet here I was, shivering and broken, standing before Simmon’s door. My knuckles hovered over the wood, hesitant. I could already imagine the rumors: *Kvothe expelled. Kvothe locked away in Haven. Kvothe, half-mad and guilty of...* What? Murder? Theft? The truth seemed worse when I couldn’t name it. I didn’t deserve Sim’s help.  

But I needed it.  

I knocked twice. It was a feeble sound, apologetic in its rhythm.  

A pause. Then footsteps, light but deliberate, approached from within. The door creaked open just enough for a sliver of light and a single, cautious eye. That eye was Sim’s, and though the door chain held him back, his worry came through plainly. His gaze landed on me—on the tangled mess of my hair, the rags clinging to me like grave clothes, the look that must have burned itself into my face after days of living on desperation alone. His hesitation cut worse than if he’d slammed the door altogether.  

He unlatched the chain and opened the door wider. “Kvothe,” he said, quiet and unsure. For a moment, I thought he wouldn’t let me in—but then he stepped back, pulling the door open fully. “Come in.”  

The warmth struck me like the sun after a cruel winter, the firelight spilling across the room painting walls and table golden. For the briefest moment, I could almost believe this was normal. That I was simply visiting an old friend. But the weight of everything crashed in on me all at once—the sleepless nights, the haunting echoes of Haven, the enormity of what I had to do. My legs buckled, and I nearly fell, catching myself against the doorframe with shaking hands.  

“Sit,” Sim said quickly, gesturing toward a chair by the fire. His tone was steady, but his brow furrowed sharply as he shut the door behind me.  

I sank into the nearest seat, my legs trembling as though the weight of the world had finally been allowed to come crashing down on them. Sim remained standing, hands fidgeting nervously and his face tight with worry. But he didn’t speak. It was his patience that undid me.  

“I made a mess, Sim,” I said at last, my voice low and raw, more like a confession than a greeting. “I’ve done things—” My throat closed over the words before I could finish, and for a moment, I couldn’t meet his gaze. Then, with a slow, heavy breath, I began talking.  

I told him everything.  

### * * *

I told him about Devi—the initial blood favor, the warnings I ignored, the mistakes I made—and how it all unraveled. I told him about the terrible way Lorren’s strength faltered and failed in front of my eyes, and about the Duplicator, how I’d used it to steal from the Archives, tracking secrets that should have been left buried.  

I told him how Haven had swallowed me whole, how Elodin had left me with nothing but riddles and warnings. And when the words grew harder to speak, with memories of Auri fragile and luminous in my mind's eye, I told him about her too. I told him about the carriage that had spirited her away and the pale ghosts I had conjured, murmuring reminders of failure at every turn. I didn’t deserve his listening ear, yet Sim stood there across from me, silent but resolute, drinking in every fractured thing I had to say.  

When I finished, silence stretched thin between us, broken only by the crackle of the fire. Sim’s hands twisted together in front of him. His face was pale, and his lips pressed into a tight, straight line. Finally, he spoke.  

“Kvothe…” He stopped, pressing his fingers against the bridge of his nose. Then something softer slid into his voice. “You should have told us about Auri before. We could have helped her sooner. Protected her. Didn’t you think we’d care?”  

I swallowed hard, knotting my fingers in my lap. “You don’t understand,” I said, desperation creeping into my voice. “If anyone had found out about her, they would have taken her to Haven. I couldn’t... I couldn’t let that happen. But I failed her anyway.”  

Sim let the silence hang between us before nodding. “All right,” Sim said softly, folding his hands together like a man gripping something fragile. “Tell me about her. Give me her ghost, her shadow, her echoes. I’ll shake the world until it sings her back to us.”  

I told him about Auri the best I could: the moonlight sheen of her hair, the soft quickness of her movements, the way she seemed to breathe through the cracks in the world without disturbing it. Even as I spoke, Sim’s face knit into quiet doubt. I could tell he was trying not to betray how improbable this all seemed.  

Still, when I finished, he stood. “Stay here,” he said simply. “Get some rest. You look like you could fall apart at the slightest push. I’ll go see what I can find.”  

### * * *

I woke to the sound of quiet movement. Sim sat nearby, silhouetted by the fire, his face shadowed but unmistakably weary. He looked at me for a long moment before speaking.  

“I found something,” he began, his voice low.  

I sat up, every muscle aching. “Go on.”  

He hesitated, running a hand through his hair. “Someone matching her description was seen—crying, struggling. And... the carriage she was in, it bore Ambrose’s seal.”  

My stomach dropped. “Ambrose,” I said, the name curling bitterly on my tongue.  

Sim nodded reluctantly. “His coachman was seen heading toward Renere. I don’t know what it means, Kvothe, but... it doesn’t look good.”  

I leaned forward, resting my head in my hands. Waves of anger and guilt surged through me, each pulling sharper than the last. “If it’s him...” I whispered, trailing off.  

Sim leaned closer, his voice firm. “You can’t rush this. You’re already on thin ice with... everything. He could be baiting you.”  

I clenched my jaw. He was right, of course. The thought made my blood boil. “I’ll handle it,” I said, more evenly than I felt. “I can’t just sit here doing nothing.”  

Sim studied me carefully. “Then promise me you’ll be smart about this, Kvothe. Don’t rush into his trap.”  

“Smart,” I repeated, the word bitter on my tongue. “I’ll try.”  

Sim nodded, though his concern lingered in his expression. He didn’t believe me. I didn’t entirely believe myself.  

### * * *

The clothes Sim lent me hung awkwardly on my frame—loose in the waist, tight in the shoulders—but they were dry. They didn’t smell of Haven’s damp rot. That was enough.  

I had no plans to return to Sim's quiet firelight. He’d have tried to stop me, I think, or at least slowed me down. He was a good friend, perhaps too good. The kindly weight of his concern was something I couldn’t afford right now.  

Instead, I went to my apartment above Anker’s. Getting there was a risk. If Ambrose suspected I’d come back, his lackeys might have already dug their claws into it. But I wasn’t about to leave without my lute—not again. Not with what lay ahead.  

The streets of Imre didn’t feel safe, though I used them sparingly. When I finally reached the back ways near Anker’s, I kept to the shadows, ducking under grain chutes and sliding over walls slick with frost. From below, my apartment above the inn looked dark, quiet. Still, my skin prickled with the thought of traps waiting inside, some unseen thread that might snap beneath my weight and betray me.  

I scaled the stone carefully, pausing at the window’s edge. The air inside smelled faintly of wax and wood smoke—a strangely unchanged smell, as though I’d only stepped out for a drink. I scanned the room, but nothing stirred. No traps sprung at my weight when I pulled myself inside.  

The lute hung on its peg, waiting for me, and seeing it there loosened something tight in my chest. I pulled it down gently, running my fingers along the worn case before setting it into my bag. I emptied the rest of my small room—a few coins, spare strings, my last clean shirt—and slung the bag across my shoulder. 

The stillness struck me again, louder now. The fear that lingered beneath it. The knowledge that leaving this place meant leaving the last remnants of stability behind me.  

I stood carefully, my bag heavy against my shoulder, and made my way back to the open window. If the room was trapped, whatever teeth it bore had missed their chance.  

Ambrose had her. Auri. A thought that iced my veins.  

One way or another, I’d follow that thread to the end—through cold, through dark, through every shadow of that damned city he might flee to. Holding my lute close, I slipped into the night, leaving behind what little I didn’t carry.
