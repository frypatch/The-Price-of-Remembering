# CHAPTER 36.

## INTERLUDE.

## BURDENS.


KOTE STOOD BEHIND the bar at the Waystone Inn, working his cloth over a mug long past the need for cleaning. The amber light from the hearth painted it gold, then copper, then gold again as he turned it in endless circles. Outside, the wind worried at the shutters with a low, insistent moan. It searched for gaps that weren’t there, pressing against wood fitted tight as a shipwright’s best work, but inside the inn stayed warm and still. Not even a candle flame wavered.  

The scratch of Chronicler’s quill went silent as a held breath.  

“You’ve stopped writing,” Kote said, his voice low and flat. He kept his eyes on the mug, his hands still moving in their endless circles. “Why?”  

Chronicler shifted in his chair. The wood creaked a question. “I thought that perhaps this part of your story might not be something you wanted written.”  

Kote let out a slow breath, the kind that carries more weight than words. He kept polishing the mug, his hands moving in the same circles, but now the rhythm had changed. What had been smooth and thoughtless became tight, mechanical. Three more circles. Four. But when he set it down his hands trembled.  

He turned toward the hearth and braced himself against the bar. For a moment he stood perfectly still. Then his shoulders began to shake. The sob that came was ugly and harsh, a sound that had been swallowed back too many times to count.  

“I led them to their deaths. Wil. Sim. They found me bleeding against a wall, a crossbow bolt through my shoulder. They could have left then. Should have left. Denna was waiting at the gates.” His voice broke on that last word. “But I told them we had to reach the Tower. The others were trapped there. Auri. The King. I wouldn’t leave them behind.” He swallowed hard. “They walked behind me into that tower the way children follow their father through the dark, certain I knew the path ahead.” He tried to laugh, but what came out was broken and bitter. “They died because I couldn’t walk away. They died because they trusted me to lead them home.”  

His knuckles bloomed white where they gripped the bar’s edge. Chronicler set down his pen with the careful movements of someone approaching a wounded thing.  

“Kote,” he began.  

“Let me finish what I’ve started.” Kote turned, and the firelight caught his eyes, red-rimmed and glassy. When he spoke again, his voice had found its footing. “Heroes are liars, Chronicler. We tell ourselves pretty stories about wit and triumph, about clever tongues and cleverer hands. The truth tastes different. The truth is that good men die forgotten. No bard remembers their names. No song keeps their memory warm.”  

He reached into his pocket and drew out a small vial filled with milky liquid. For a moment he simply held it, watching the firelight break and scatter through the glass like promises through time. “Wil was one of the forgotten,” he said softly. “A man with an axe and a heart too large for his chest. No grace in his movements. No training in his bones. But when the room filled with knights and drawn swords, when Sim and I stood at the edge of breaking, Wil charged into that storm of blades.”  

Kote opened the vial and took a careful swallow. His face softened, but his words kept their edges.  

“He swung that axe like a prayer made of iron and fury. It bought us moments. Just moments. But one man against many equals one kind of ending.” His voice dropped to barely more than breath. “Wil always knew where his road would end. He walked it anyway. Tehlu forgive me. That road should have been mine to walk.”  

“And Sim.” Kote set the vial on the counter with unsteady hands. He stared at it for a long moment. “Simmon the gentle. Sim who complained that every blade was balanced wrong, made for hands that weren’t his.” His voice dropped low, barely more than breath. “I never thought to see what I saw that day. Gods help me, not from Sim.”  

He drew a hand down his face. “One moment he was the Sim I knew, all worry and careful thought. The next, he spoke the Name of Iron.” Kote closed his eyes. “I will never understand why that was hiding in his heart. There is a particular horror in watching gentleness transform into wrath. He didn’t wield his sword. He became it.”  

Behind him, Bast moved. He laid a hand on Kote’s shoulder, steady and quiet, and something in Kote’s posture eased. As if that touch gave him permission to continue.  

“Every strike was an affront to the life Sim had lived. With each swing, pieces of that gentle man I knew fell away.” His eyes lifted, but they held only loss now. “In his last moments, he turned to me. His lips moved, trying to give me something. Warning? Farewell? Forgiveness? I will never know.”  

The fire popped and crackled in the silence. A log shifted, the coals below it collapsing into ash. Kote leaned forward, his forearms resting on the counter, anchoring himself to the wood, to this moment, to the inn around him.  

After a long silence, he spoke again, his voice no louder than the fire’s whisper. “The world will forget Wil. It will forget Sim. Men like them fall through the cracks of history like rain through broken roof tiles.” He looked up at Chronicler. “But you remember things. That’s your calling. Your burden.” He gestured toward the waiting quill. “So write them true. Maybe not today or tomorrow. But someday, when you find yourself alone with ink and memory, write them as they were. Give Wil his graceless glory. Give Sim his quiet brilliance. Let their whole lives breathe on your pages, not just the breath of their final days. They deserve that much and more, but this is all we have to give.”  

Chronicler nodded once. No words could serve better than silence.  

Kote straightened then, pulling the innkeeper’s mask back over his features with practiced ease. He smoothed his apron and gestured to the pen resting in Chronicler’s hand.  

“Someday you’ll write their stories whole and true. But for now, this piece of their ending belongs in my telling too. They are threads woven through my tale, and to leave them out would be to tell a lie through silence.” He gestured toward the waiting pen. “So write it down, Chronicler. Write how they died for me. Then we move forward.”  

He turned back to the hearth, squaring his shoulders beneath the weight of memory. “My story has far to go before it finds its rest. Best we continue while we can.”
