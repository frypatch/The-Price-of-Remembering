# CHAPTER 36.

## INTERLUDE.

## BURDENS.


KOTE STOOD BEHIND THE bar at the Waystone Inn, polishing a mug that had already surrendered its every stain to his careful hands. The amber light from the hearth painted it gold, then copper, then gold again as he turned it in endless circles. His movements carried the weight of ritual, each pass of the cloth a prayer to the present moment, a tether to keep him from drifting into memory’s darker waters. Outside, the wind pressed its face against the shutters like a beggar at a feast. Its voice found the gaps between wood and nail, threading through the quiet corners of the room with a sound like old grief seeking new ears.  

The scratch of Chronicler’s quill went silent as a held breath.  

“You’ve stopped, you know,” Kote said suddenly, his voice low and flat. “Why?”  

Chronicler shifted in his chair. The wood creaked a question. “I thought perhaps this part of your story might not be something you wanted written.”  

A sound escaped Kote’s throat, sharp and bitter as winter wine. His hands stilled on the mug, the cloth frozen mid-circle. For a long moment he stood thus, caught between motion and stillness, between speaking and silence. When he finally set the mug down, his movements were careful and slow, as if the simple act required all his concentration. The mug touched the bar with barely a whisper, but his hands trembled as they released it, and he gripped the edge of the bar to hide their shaking.  

He turned toward the hearth, one hand braced against the bar’s worn wood, the other pressed to his chest as if holding closed a door that wanted desperately to open. His breath caught once, twice, then shattered into something raw and terrible. The sob that tore free from him sounded like cloth ripping, like something vital giving way beneath impossible weight.  

“I led them to their deaths.” The words fell from him like stones into still water. “Wil. Sim. They came for me. Broke through stone and steel to pull me from that place, and I wouldn’t leave. Not without her.” His voice cracked on the last word. “They followed me to the tower because they trusted me. Because they believed I knew the way through. They walked behind me the way children follow their father through the dark, certain of the path ahead.” He tried to laugh, but the sound caught in his throat like water in a broken pipe. “An arrow in my shoulder and too much stubbornness in my bones, and still they followed. They died because I couldn’t abandon Auri. They died because they trusted me to lead them home.”  

His knuckles bloomed white where they gripped the bar’s edge. Chronicler set his pen down with the care one might use to lay a sleeping child in its bed.
“Kote,” he began.  

“Let me finish what I’ve started.” Kote turned, and the firelight found his eyes, red-rimmed and glassy. When he spoke again, his voice had found its footing. “Heroes are liars, Chronicler. We tell ourselves pretty stories about wit and triumph, about clever tongues and clever hands. The truth tastes different. The truth is that good men die forgotten. No bard remembers their names. No song keeps their memory warm.”  

He reached into his pocket and drew out a small vial filled with milky liquid. For a moment he simply held it, watching the firelight break and scatter through the glass like promises through time. “Wil was one of them,” he murmured. “A man with an axe and a heart too large for his chest. No grace in his movements. No training in his bones. And yet, when the room filled with knights, when Sim and I were on the edge of breaking, Wil stood.”  

Kote opened the vial and took a careful swallow. His face softened, but his words kept their edges.  

“He threw himself at them, swinging that axe not with skill but with a prayer. It bought us moments. Just moments. But he knew. Wil always knew where his road would end. He walked it anyway.” His voice dropped to barely more than breath. “Tehlu forgive me. That road should have been mine to walk.”  

“And Sim.” Kote’s hand trembled as he set the vial on the counter. For a long moment he stared at it, as if the answers he needed might be hiding in the dark swirl of liquid within. “Simmon the gentle. Sim the scholar.” His voice softened with each word. “The boy who could hardly hold a blade without grumbling about its balance. I never thought I would see it. Sweet Tehlu, not Sim.”  

He drew a hand down his face, slow and weary as a man carrying stones uphill. “I cannot say how it happened. One moment he was the same Sim I had always known, anxious and thoughtful, turning every problem over in his mind like a puzzle box with too many pieces. The next moment he was something else entirely.”  

Kote closed his eyes, let the silence fill the space between heartbeats. “He spoke the Name of Iron. How he found that terrible word hiding in his throat, I will never know. There is a horror in watching someone you love become wrath itself. He did not simply swing steel through air. He became the blade, moved like he had been born for that single moment of violence.” Kote’s voice grew quieter still, as if speaking the words might summon back that terrible moment. “It cost him everything.” He opened his eyes, and they held no anger now, only the deep weariness of stones worn smooth by countless years of rain. “Each strike took something from him. When the knights lay scattered and still, when the blood had finished its flowing, he died on his knees in the settling dust. Not from fear. Not from wounds that would heal. He died beneath the weight of what he had become. He carried us that day, and it crushed him like grain beneath the millstone.”  

The fire crackled, filling the spaces between words with its own small violence. Kote leaned forward, his forearms resting on the counter, anchoring himself to this moment, this place, this particular grief.  

After a long silence, he spoke again, his voice no louder than the fire’s whisper. “The world will forget Wil. It will forget Sim. Men like them fall through the cracks of history like rain through broken roof tiles.” He looked up at Chronicler, his gaze sharp as winter starlight. “But you remember things, don’t you? That’s your calling. Your burden. The pen only stops dancing when you let the music die.”  

The fire crackled and hissed, filling the empty spaces where words might have lived. Kote leaned forward, forearms resting on the bar as if he might anchor himself to something solid and real.  

After a long pause, he spoke again, quieter now. “The world won’t remember Wil. Or Sim. People like that slip through the cracks of history.” He glanced up at Chronicler, his gaze sharper than before. . “But you remember. That is why you carry ink and parchment, is it not? Your pen stops only when you choose to let something die.”  

Chronicler nodded once. No words would serve better than silence.  

“Write them,” Kote said, his words firm and clear. “Not today. Not tomorrow. But someday, when you find yourself alone with only ink for company, write them as they were. Give Wil his graceless glory. Give Sim his quiet brilliance breaking into terrible bloom. Let them breathe again on your pages, even if only for the span of a candle’s burning. They deserve that much. They deserve more than I can give, but this is all I have left to offer.”  

He reached for the vial once more but held back, his hand hovering over it. His eyes drifted to the hearth, seeing through the flames to some distant place where different fires burned. When he spoke again, his words were soft as ash falling.  

“Sim. Wil.”  

Their names settled over the room like snow over gravestones.  

Kote straightened then, pulling the innkeeper’s mask back over his features with practiced ease. He smoothed his apron and gestured to the pen resting in Chronicler’s hand.  

“Someday you’ll write their stories whole and true. But today, this piece of their ending belongs in my telling too. They are threads woven through my tale, and to leave them out would be to tell a lie through silence.” He gestured toward the waiting pen. “So write it down, Chronicler. Write how they died for me. Then we move forward. My story has far to go before it finds its rest.”  

He turned back to the hearth, squaring his shoulders beneath the weight of memory. “The day is patient, but not endless. Best we continue while we can.”
