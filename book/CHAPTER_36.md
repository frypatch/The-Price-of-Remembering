# CHAPTER 36

## Interlude

## A WEIGHT OF NAMES

KOTE STOOD BEHIND THE Waystone Inn's bar, wiping the same mug for the third time, though it gleamed clean under the amber flicker of the hearth. His movements were slow, deliberate, like a man trying to tether himself to the present. Outside, wind pressed against the shutters, a soft howling that always seemed to find its way into this quiet corner of the world.  

“You’ve stopped, you know,” Kote said suddenly, his voice low and flat.  

The scratch of the Chronicler’s quill ceased on the parchment. Kote didn’t look up, his hands still tracing the rim of the mug. “Your pen. It’s silent. Why?”  

Chronicler hesitated before answering. “I suppose…” He shifted in his seat. “I suppose I thought this part of the story wasn’t something you’d want… written down.”  

Kote exhaled sharply, a bitter sound. “You’re not wrong.” He placed the mug down harder than necessary, the faint clink of it against the wood sharper than the quiet around them. “Some things shouldn’t survive the telling.”  

He turned toward the hearth, one hand bracing himself against the bar, the other pressed to the hollow of his chest. His breathing hitched once, almost imperceptibly. Then it came, heavy and jagged—a sob that ripped free of him like a wound reopened. There it was, the grief he had tucked away in some deep, forgotten corner finally surfacing.  

“I led them to their deaths,” he said, his voice cracking under the weight of the words. “Wil. Sim. They didn’t hesitate. Not once. They walked into that fight knowing they wouldn’t come out because…” Kote laughed bitterly, shaking his head. “Because of me. Because I couldn’t stand on my own, and they—” He broke off, his knuckles whitening as they gripped the bar.  

Chronicler set down his pen with care, the sound deliberate. “Kote—”  

“No, let me say this.” He finally turned, eyes glassy and rimmed red, but his voice steadied through sheer force of will. “Heroes don’t save the day. Not always. The world weaves stories, songs, tales of triumph and wit. But the truth—the brutal, bloody truth—is men like Wil don’t get songs. No bard carries their name. No melody hums their feats.”  

He fumbled into his pocket and pulled out a small vial of milky liquid. For a moment, he simply held it, the firelight refracting through the glass. “Wil was one of them,” he murmured. “Just a man with an axe. All brawn. No training. And yet, when the room filled with knights, when Sim and I were on the edge of breaking, Wil stood. He stood.”  

Kote uncorked the vial, tipping some of the liquid into his mouth. His features slackened slightly, smoothing into something quieter, though his voice retained its edge. “He threw himself into them, swinging wildly. Not with skill, no, but with purpose—enough to buy us another few moments. He knew he wouldn’t survive it. Wil always knew where his story would end, and he didn’t try to change it. Tehlu forgive me, it should’ve been mine instead.”

“And Sim…” Kote’s hand trembled as he set the vial down on the counter. For a long moment, he stared at it as though the answers he sought might be found swirling in its depths. “Simmon the gentle, Sim the scholar,” he said, his voice softening. “The boy who could hardly hold a blade without complaining about the balance. I never thought… Gods, not Sim.”  

He ran a hand down his face, the movement slow and wearied. “I don’t even know how it happened. One moment, he’s the same Sim I’ve always known—anxious, overthinking. And the next… He wasn’t just brave. He was something else. Something I don’t have the words for.”  

Kote closed his eyes, the silence between his words stretching taut. “He called the Name of Iron. I’ll never know how he found it in him, but he did. There’s something terrifying about seeing someone you love become wrath. He wasn’t swinging a sword—he *was* the sword. Moving like he’d been born to wield it, like his life had been meant for that single moment.”  

Chronicler broke the silence this time, a quiet question in his tone. “What did he sacrifice for it?”  

“Everything,” Kote said simply. His eyes opened, and for the first time, there was no anger—only fatigue. “Each strike cost him a piece of himself. And when it was over, when the knights were scattered around him in bloody heaps…” A bitter smile tugged at his lips. “He died on his knees. Not from fear. Not from the wounds. From the weight of it. He carried us that day, and it crushed him.”  

### * * *

The fire crackled, filling the empty spaces between words. Kote leaned forward, resting his forearms on the counter as though trying to ground himself.  

After a long pause, he spoke again, quieter now. “The world won’t remember Wil. Or Sim. People like that slip through the cracks of history.” He glanced up at Chronicler, his gaze sharper than before. “But you will. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? The pen only stops when you choose to let something die.”  

Chronicler’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t look away. “What are you asking me to do?”  

“Write them,” Kote said firmly. “Not tomorrow. Not today. But someday, when you’re holed up in some frozen cabin with nothing but ink for company, write them. Not the versions the world would want. Write Wil’s clumsy, graceless fight. Write Sim’s quiet acts of brilliance. Let them live again, even if it’s only in the flicker of a lantern and the scratch of quill on parchment.”  

Chronicler nodded once, his throat bobbing as he swallowed back whatever words he might have said in return.  

Kote exhaled and leaned back. “They deserve more than this poor telling,” he added, softer now. “But it’s all I have left to give.”  

The innkeeper reached for the vial again but held back, his hand hovering over it. His eyes drifted toward the hearth, unfocused, distant. Finally, he whispered something under his breath, so softly that Chronicler had to lean forward to catch it.  

“Sim… Wil…”  

And then the silence closed in, gentle and heavy as snowfall. 

At that, Kote pushed himself upright and straightened his apron, the mask of the innkeeper settling back over him. He gestured toward the Chronicler’s pen.

“And for now, this part of the story remains yours to write. So keep writing, Chronicler. That’s why you’re here after all, isn’t it?”

He turned toward the hearth again, his voice distant now. “Their story deserves the telling. Even if the world doesn’t deserve them.”
