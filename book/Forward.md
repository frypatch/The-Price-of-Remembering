# FORWARD.


Welcome fellow ‘Old Knowers’ and ‘Proud Dreamers’. As an exercise I thought it would be interesting to piece together some of the prevailing book three theories into a streamlined version of what we may potentially receive. Let me preface this by saying that this interpretation will unquestionably deviate on many accounts from Pat’s final version, and though I don’t believe there is sufficient information to truly piece “The Doors of Stone” together in its entirety, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying.  

After so many years the fanbase is unlikely to settle on any one conclusion, a problem Pat himself will likely face when delivering his own resolution. With that in mind, remember that this is merely an ending and not the ending. It’s also worth noting that given the considerably shorter length, this version will lack much of the intricacy and nuance that are hallmarks of the series, though there remains potential to expand based on community feedback.  

While Kvothe has stated that stories seldom take the straightest path, for this fan version I’ve attempted to be as forthright as possible. I started by constructing a high-level outline using only what we can logically surmise from the existing books, interviews, and other official media, then combined this foundation with some of the more accepted fan theories developed over the years. The goal is to resolve as many plot threads as possible while delivering as satisfying a conclusion as I can to what’s already been established.  

For the areas where I’ve been forced to fill gaps with original elements, I’ve tried to do so in a limited and respectful manner. My hope with this endeavor is to entertain while encouraging members of the community to consider the broader implications of theories posed. Like Kvothe when attempting to understand the Lethani, perhaps we can somehow pull the answers from within ourselves.  

For those reading this I place no expectations upon you, though should you wish to provide input it would be greatly appreciated. You will find that much of this remains quite rough, but I’m hoping that with your assistance we can iron out its flaws. In regard to editing, I am open to the concept of making changes, particularly in the vein of matching the tone and prose of the existing novels, but am also open to plot changes, so long as the proposed alterations are not too extensive.  

I appreciate this won’t be for everyone, however I offer it without obligation, let, or lean :)  

That all said, please enjoy.
