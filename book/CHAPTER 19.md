# CHAPTER 19

## Amber and Ivory  

The air bit at my skin as we stepped out of the Fae. Sharp, cold, honest.  

I hadn’t realized how thick the air had been there, thick as amber poured too slowly. How warm and sweet the light had been, pressing against my skin like a hand held too long on the back of my neck. I hadn’t noticed, not until it was gone.  

Now the world was crisp again, cut clean in hard-edged light and scent. The earth felt real under my feet. My own body felt heavier, my limbs made of flesh and bone instead of silk and story.  

I let out a slow breath. We'd made it.  

Wil and Sim shifted beside me, stretching the way a man does after too long in bed. I could see the moment they registered the weight of their own limbs again, the sharpness of the world.

Then there was Bast.

Unlike the rest of us, Bast did not move as if shaking off some unseen burden. He simply stood, still and considering. His eyes drifted shut for a moment, his hands loose at his sides.

Then he took a slow breath—long and deliberate. Testing.

A small sound escaped him, something almost like amusement, almost like pleasure.

"Ah," he murmured. "Now I remember how heavy all this is."

I turned to glance at him, and there he was: wholly unchanged, yet entirely different. Here, in the mortal world, the shape of him meant something again. Everything about him was a careful act: his stance, his slouch, the precise way he breathed.

To his credit, his glamourie was well-woven. It had to be. The Fae do not belong in the mortal world, and the world knows it. Sometimes in whispers. Sometimes in screams. But always in blood.

Bast knew this better than most. So he crouched, adjusting where the seams of himself blurred too thin. A flick of fingers across his cheekbones, dulling their sharpness. A smooth drag down his side, settling the curve of boots that hid the cloven hooves beneath.

When he straightened, he rolled his shoulders like a cat waking from indifferent sleep. Not satisfied, not comfortable. But finished.

Behind him, the waystones loomed—a towering cluster of gray pillars. Their shape twisted strangely if you looked too long. A path not meant for mortal eyes.

Sim exhaled slowly. “I still don’t understand how you knew where we'd come out.”

Bast grinned, teeth flashing. “Don’t you?”

Sim frowned. “No.”

“Good.” He clapped Sim on the back. “That will make it twice as difficult when you try it on your own and fail spectacularly.”

Sim looked no less confused, but as Bast moved forward toward the ridge, he followed.

I did as well.

Because the truth was, whether or not I understood it, Bast had led us true. And now, we stood in the high hills overlooking Renere.

I turned my gaze toward the city spread before us, tangled with bridges and canals, vast beneath the bent light of the afternoon sun.

"Vast," he said, tasting the word as though he might swallow it whole. "Knotted. Hungry."  

I cast a glance toward the sprawl of Renere, all tangled canals and sharp spires and streets that twisted in impossible geometry. "You sound like you like it."  

"I don’t know yet."  

I caught the faint furrow in his brow as his sharp gaze flickered across the rooftops, to the taut linen lines strung between high windows, bright silks drying in the open air. Feelers searching. Measuring.  

Then, more to himself than us, he mused, "It doesn’t swallow strangers as politely as the Fae, though. That’s something."  

I sighed. "That makes one of us."  

Bast turned his charming smile on me, all teeth and mischief.  

Then, in one easy flick of movement, he vaulted smoothly from the embankment, landing beside me with uncanny lightness.  

He dusted his hands together as if settling the matter.  

"Onward to our inevitable doom," he declared brightly.  

"Fate hasn’t decided that yet," I muttered.  

Bast tipped his head to the side, like a hound catching a distant sound. And then, quietly, almost sweetly:  

"Hasn’t it?"  

***

A gondola would have been easier. The dockmen whistled as we passed, mindful of their poled crafts as they cut lazily through the silver-blue shallows. They gestured toward the open seats, calling out offers no true noble would acknowledge.

Sim almost caved. Almost.

Then Wil snorted. And Bast flicked his gaze toward him with a look of pleased curiosity, as if he’d already begun reading Wilem by what he chose to scorn.

"Afraid of a little walking, Simmon?" Bast asked, in the manner of a man dropping a coin just to watch a beggar decide what dignity is worth.

To his credit, Sim straightened immediately. "Obviously not."

Wil grunted his approval. "Then we walk."

That was fine with me. A city can’t be known except by its streets. You have to feel it underfoot, listen to how it sings, how it murmurs, whether it whets its teeth on laughter or whispers secrets in stolen steps.

Tarbean had leered at me, sprawling and broken, full of jagged edges and cutting smiles. Imre had sung, all light and laughter, wealth and easy kindness.

Renere?

Renere did neither.

The city did not welcome. It did not leer. It swallowed.

The streets teemed with people, all moving in the sharp, choreographed chaos of somewhere made to consume coin and breath alike. Silk-sashed bravos walked among hard-eyed merchants. Street performers spun and leapt in wide courtyards, laughter ringing against stone. Everywhere, the sharp scent of cut citrus struggled against the heavier notes of riverwater and the lingering perfume of money.

You could measure a man’s worth by his collar, by the weight of his rings. And you could measure his danger by how easily he walked a city crowded with thieves.

Bast seemed almost relaxed. Almost.

For the last hour, he had prowled the streets at my side, but never where I expected him. One moment, he was just behind me. The next, sidling behind Wil and eyeing street performers from under his lashes. A few minutes later, when I turned to glance back, he was nowhere at all.

Then, impossibly, he was ahead of us, leaning lazily against a lamppost, watching our approach with the smug satisfaction of a cat watching pigeons wander too close.

He wasn’t just wandering. He was testing the city.

He noted rooftops. He pressed palms to market stalls, gauging how sturdy they were. He fell behind for just long enough to poke his head into an alley, then reappeared as if he’d never left.

Bast was listening to the city.

After a time, I realized Wil had noticed, too.

He wasn’t watching Bast in suspicion—not quite. More like a man listening at a locked door, waiting to hear whether there was music inside or something with teeth.

Bast caught Wil’s stare. He curved an eyebrow, then smirked and tilted his head just slightly. His smile—slow and sharp-edged—was unquestionably a challenge.

“Oh, careful, dear Wilem,” Bast said. “If you stare any longer, I’ll start thinking you fancy me.”

Wil didn’t slow his pace. He didn’t even blink. “I already have one reckless bastard to look after. I don’t need another.”

That startled real laughter out of Bast—bright and genuine. “Oh,” he breathed, delighted. “I take back every unflattering thing I’ve ever thought about you.”

“You’ve known me a day,” Wil said dryly.

Bast shrugged. “Some people inspire insults faster than others.”

Sim narrowed his eyes at Bast. Then he looked at Wilem. Then at me.

Finally, he sighed heavily, as if resigning to fate. "God help me, I think you will get along."

Bast grinned as if he'd just won a bet.  

***

The noise reached us.  

Not laughter. Not the vendor calls. Not the living hum of a city.  

Rhythmic, steady. A voice above the others.  

A pulse in the air, deep and thrumming.  

Up ahead, the street had thickened— movement slowing, growing dense, a clot where people had backed away but not yet fled.  

Wilem frowned.  

Sim took an uncertain step forward.  

Across the square, something loomed in sharp relief. Thirty feet of black stone. Not a tower. Not a wall.  

A man.  

He stood frozen mid-step, one foot placed forward, saber thrust downward, as if pinning the very city beneath him.  

King Feyda.  

Even his statue looked patient. Waiting. Watching.  

And at its feet, a crowd had gathered.  

Bast exhaled in something that was not quite amusement. "Now what's this lovely little snarl?"  

Sim hesitated. "They're just... street preachers?"  

I glanced at their hands.  

Not clasped in prayer. Not raised in invocation. Arms crossed tight over thick shoulders.  

Not spiritual fervor.  

Something sharper.  

Wilem had caught it too. His expression had gone stony.  

"This isn’t a sermon," I murmured.  

The chanting surged. Their voices grew tight, not quite a shout, not quite battle-bright, but dangerously close.  

Sim had gone pale. "We should—"  

Then, the first soldiers pressed their way into the crowd—blue-and-gold uniforms pushing against the brown-robed bodies pushing back.  

The air had not yet broken, but it was bracing itself. Just a breath, held too long.  

A single wrong moment, and everything would turn.  

Bast rolled his shoulders, exhaling long and low. As if standing still was costing him something.  

I made my choice.  

“Bast.” My voice was low. Steady. “Find us a way around.”  

Bast turned his head slightly, just enough that the city’s half-light caught in his eyes. His grin was slow and lazy, but there was nothing careless about it.  

“Oh,” he murmured. “Now you like my tricks.”  

The air in the square grew heavier. Someone had begun to shout.  

“Bast.”  

He sighed, tilting his head back with the air of someone scenting storm clouds. His gaze flicked up toward rooftops, then down a tight alley none of us had even glanced at twice. His fingers flexed by his side.  

Then, with the languid ease of stretching his legs after a long nap, Bast stepped away, slipping toward the alley with confident, careless grace.  

Wil murmured at my side. "You trust him to know where he's going?"  

No.  

But that didn’t matter.  

"I trust him to move as if he belongs," I murmured back. "And half the time, that's enough."  

"Half the time?” Sim whispered, voice rising slightly.  

Steel caught the light across the square.  

Not yet drawn. Not yet swung.  

But enough.  

***

When the White Citadel gates rose before us, my legs ached and my fine new tunic had gathered the dull grit of Renere’s streets.  

If Severen had shimmered with nobility, King Roderick's court simply burned. Everything was too white, polished within an inch of sanity. It was a fortress built to stab upward, high and narrow, its upper towers so distant I tilted too far back trying to count them.  

Sim steadied me with a hand before mumbling, “Just as well. Someone would have charged you tax for looking too long.”  

It was a jest I would have laughed at. If I hadn't seen what rolled past the gates.  

A carriage.  

Heavy. Gilded. Loud in color and presence, the kind of garish thing that used gold like perfume, overdone to the point of suffocation.  

And on its door, pressed in shining metal, was a crest that made my blood catch fire.  

House Jakis.  

I turned too sharply. My hands were fists before I had thought, before I had considered.  

Sim saw. So did Wil.  

I didn't say it outright. I didn’t need to. We all knew. Ambrose was here. With Auri.  

Wil stepped neatly into my path, blocking me before I could so much as breathe forward. “I know that face, Kvothe.”  

“She doesn’t belong here,” I told him, though my throat had seized up tight.  

“She didn’t belong in the Underthing either.” Sim’s voice was almost gentle, and that made it worse. “What if she’s better here?”  

“She won’t be.” The air in my chest burned. “She can't be.”  

My body made a decision before my mind did. A step forward, toward the gate, toward steel-rimmed doors and a fool’s arrogance.  

Wil snatched my sleeve. “Brilliant plan. Charge headfirst into the White Citadel and get thrown in a stone cell before the hour’s end.”  

I knew he was right. My fists stayed curled, the heat wound tight in my chest.  

“Fine. We bluff our way inside.” My voice hardly sounded like my own. “We find her before Ambrose gets his claws in.”  

***

Disguises are tricky things. The bad ones rely on deception. The good ones rely on truth—small truths, carefully chosen, painted larger than life.  

And it just so happened that I had a dangerous truth at my disposal: I had once been a court musician to the Maer of Vintas.  

Wil and Sim, skeptical at first, quickly warmed to the plan when they realized how easily it could be done. The Maer’s name carried weight here, and I carried the writ of patronage to prove it. What I lacked in money, I made up for in arrogant improvisation.  

After arranging rooms at a nearby inn named the Blind Beggar, I sifted through the market with Gemmel-trained efficiency, plucking the barest essentials: a blue-and-ivory silk sash (for the Maer’s colors), a ribbon worked into Sim’s curls, and a tailored waistcoat with silver buckles for Wil. Bast, predictably, fought me at first—but by the end, I caught him admiring the way deep navy suited his sharp frame.  

"You’re enjoying this," I accused.  

“I have no idea what you mean,” Bast purred, adjusting his cuffs.  

By the time we reached the White Citadel’s outer gate, we looked the part—brilliant in noble colors, fine enough to pass, rich enough to ward off suspicion. The guards eyed us, but I was already slipping the writ into the waiting hands of the officer before he could ask for it.  

The man frowned, turning over the parchment before glancing up at me. "You claim patronage under Alveron?" His voice held doubt, but only a little.  

"He has sent me ahead," I replied smoothly, "in confidence. The court at Severen awaits his word in your king’s favor."  

This wasn’t entirely untrue. The Maer maintained correspondence with Roderick’s court, and while I hardly ranked among official diplomats, no one at this gate could be sure of that.  

The officer hesitated for only a moment, then waved us through.  

Just like that.  

Wil let out a slow breath once we were beyond earshot. "You make that look too easy."  

"That’s the trick," I murmured. "If you pretend to belong, half the time, nobody checks."  

***

I left that night with bruised ribs and wrecked pride.  

The court had thrown me out, discarded me like a troublesome stray howling at their doors. My body ached from where the guards’ gauntlets had struck, but my mind was worse—shattered, unraveling, crashing through endless ifs and whens and should-have-saids.  

But most of all, I was drowning in her name.  

Not Auri.  

Ariel.  

They had called her Princess Ariel, and no one had questioned it. No one saw a girl of small, sharp bones and moonlight laughter. No one saw the girl who had danced barefoot in the Underthing. They saw what they wanted to see: a daughter of Roderick. A piece moved into place. A lamb turned princess.  

I had opened my mouth to speak the truth. Had shouted it to the rafters, raw and reckless.  

And no one had listened.  

No one had seen what was wrong.  

How her braid was too tight, the gleam of her hair too perfect. How her shoulders did not rest but locked, sitting still as broken clock hands. How her hands stayed still in her lap, too still—gloved fingers curled in patient tension, twisted beneath silk. How she tilted her head exactly the way a doll would, listening, nodding, smiling just so.  

I had seen it.  

And so had Ambrose.  

He stood at her side as if he belonged there, speaking in a voice like warm honey left too long in the sun, sticky and cloying. He petitioned for her hand, full of grace and easy, practiced charm. And Roderick—her father—nodded his approval.  

It had broken something in me.  

I remember shouting. I remember trying to wrench the weight of the world away by sheer force of will. But court does not listen to broken things, and so I had been discarded. A reckless interloper. A fool.  

And Auri—Ariel—had spoken just once.  

Not with the voice I knew, full of lilt and laughter. But in a whisper, quiet as falling dust.  

"Please don’t hurt him."  

Then the guards had struck me down. And I had nothing left.

We stood outside the Citadel now, the air heavy with failure. Something brittle had settled between us in the silence.  

Wil was the one to break it. “Kvothe,” he murmured, his voice quiet and careful. “We’ve got company.”  

I looked up just as the man arrived. He stepped into the flickering torchlight without hurry, dressed in a coat that shimmered like an oil-slick in the evening dark. His mustache was precise as a quill line, his posture effortless, his rings gleaming just enough to catch notice without appearing garish.  

Some would have called him a bastard made out of silk and sharp places.  

“Quite the bold performance you made in there,” he said, his voice slick with amusement. “Kvothe, isn’t it? Or shall I call you something more... inventive?”  

I hadn’t given him my name. That fact settled like iron in my stomach.  

“I don’t believe we’ve been introduced,” I said lightly, keeping my voice steady.  

He smiled, all teeth. “Nor have we. I am Fascino. Regent of nothing important, though I suspect our interests overlap. For instance...”  

He studied me, slow and knowing. “You seem quite... familiar with our dear, luminous Princess Ariel.”  

My heart clawed its way into my throat. I was conscious of Bast stilling beside me. Of Wil shifting his weight. Of Sim’s fingers tightening ever-so-slightly at his sleeve.  

Fascino saw it all. And smiled again, the kind of smile that knew all the ways a knife could be used.  

“She is a delight, isn’t she?” he continued, voice like silk-wrapped steel. “Our lost princess returned. Our jewel of court. They say she was found near the University, wandering half-mad beneath the city streets. A tragedy, really. But fortunate, all things considered.”  

I met his gaze. “Fortunate for whom?”  

“Oh, for many,” Fascino said easily, flicking a speck of dust from his sleeve. “For King Roderick, having his wayward daughter miraculously returned. For the ladies of the court, thrilled to welcome a new curiosity in their midst. And, of course...” He let the words drag, savoring the taste of them. “For the Jakis heir, who now finds himself in the golden company of royalty.”  

I felt something shift inside me, something raw and wrong.  

Fascino tilted his head, watching me closely. “Come to my gathering tonight. The Palazzo de Contraier. A private affair. No guards, no scrutiny. You should come—it might serve you to… mingle with friends of mutual distaste for a certain Jakis boy.”  

He stepped back, all coiled grace. Then he turned, leaving a faint suggestion of perfume and wealth in his wake.  

Wil exhaled sharply. “Kvothe, do you trust him?”  

I should have said no.  

But I was watching Fascino retreat into the dusk, his movements too smooth, his offer too careful, and I knew.  

“It’s not a question of trust,” I murmured. “But of choice.”
