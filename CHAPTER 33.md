# CHAPTER 33

## The Tower  

The smell struck first: sour ale soaked into wood, a rancid smear of spilled grease, and the cloying tang of too many unwashed bodies packed into one space. The garrison was a shattered remnant of what it should have been. Sixteen guards sat or slumped in a room built to hold twice their number, most clutching bottles with lethargic grips. Some blinked at me glassily, their faces slack with drink. Others ignored my entrance altogether, their shoulders slumped like scarecrows abandoned in a storm.

This was no fortress. It was a hollow shell drowning in surrender.  

Roderick paced near the center of the room, his voice sharp against the drunken murmurs. “Ready yourselves! Get moving, damn you! They’ll be at the gates any moment!” His words stumbled against their indifference, the authority in his tone stretched thin—something brittle pretending to be stone.  

For a moment, my eyes met his, and I saw it plainly: the panic behind the orders. The words weren’t just for his men. They were for himself, a faltering refrain against the crushing weight of betrayal.  

“Kvothe!” Auri’s voice snapped me back. She darted toward me, her wide eyes fixed on the fresh stain blooming across my shoulder. “You’re hurt!”

I glanced at my shoulder to finally appraise the crossbow bolt that had lodged itself beneath my clavicle. Four inches of blackened oak jutted out like a cruel joke, just shallow enough to let me stand, just deep enough to remind me of the delicate symmetry that might let me live another hour. *Lucky,* I thought, but saying that felt wrong. What kind of fool calls himself lucky with a piece of wood sticking out of his chest?

“I’ll live,” I said, though the sharp sting when I moved told a different story.

“Looks pretty awful,” Sim said, paling as he came up behind me.

“I know what to do!” Auri said suddenly. Her voice, as always, had a lightness to it, but a sharpness crept in as she grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stool. *Auri wanting to help—of course—but Auri taking charge?* That was new.

Auri was already pulling a fresh strip from the sleeve of her dress. She dropped her voice into something soothing but curt, like a mother speaking to a child who refused to sit still. “You’re going to sit here. And stay. No moving about until I’ve dealt with this mess.”

When I started to argue, she pressed a wad of linen between my teeth. “Bite down. A hedgehog with a bolt in its chest isn’t very convincing.”  

I glared, but her calm defiance left no room for protest. She gestured briskly to Sim, who hovered nearby. “Steady the bolt. Just behind the base, yes—there. And you,” she barked at Wil, “snap the shaft, clean and quick.”  

Wil’s expression soured. “Quick’s easy. Clean’s the problem.”  

Auri didn’t answer, her small hands already gathering what she needed. Then, without preamble, Wil broke the shaft. The room narrowed to a single sharp crack, like stone splitting under frost.  

Pain seared through me, pure and hot, scattering every coherent thought. My vision blurred. I barely registered Auri pulling the bolt free, her movements precise but pitiless, her smallest motions practiced and deliberate. Somewhere beyond the haze of agony, Sim dry-heaved, and Wil turned away, muttering sharp curses under his breath.  

“You’re lucky it hit where it did,” Auri said after a long, breathless moment, tying the final strip snugly around my shoulder. “No bone, no veins. Just your pride.”  

I blinked away tears of pain to look at her clearly. This wasn’t the shy hermit I had coaxed out from quiet corners. This was someone else, someone steady and quick and knowing. Was she trained in the Medica? That wasn’t right—I would have known.

Nearby, Roderick watched her with an expression I couldn’t entirely place—a strange mix of confusion, pride, and what might have been guilt.  

“Did you learn that at the University?” the King asked carefully.  

Auri’s hands stilled for the briefest of moments. She met his gaze head-on and nodded. “Of course,” she said softly.  

Roderick opened his mouth to say something more but stopped himself. He turned sharply away, his jaw clenched tight.

The tower groaned as I stumbled to the narrow arrow slits. Some men had roused themselves enough to join me, their faces pale against the lamplight. The scene outside defied any hope I might have clung to.  

Fascino’s forces moved with rhythmic precision, their scarlet banners streaming like fire in the wind. Tight formations surged around the tower’s base, shield bearers at the front, the sharpened hunger of battle reflected in every step. In their midst, the massive timber battering ram loomed like a dark god, the heads of its crew bent over it as they prepared for their approach.  

I pressed a hand into the cold stone, breathing through the ache in my shoulder. From beside me, Sim spoke softly. “We’re trapped, aren’t we?”

I didn’t answer.  

“Lugosi will come,” Roderick muttered behind me, his voice brittle and distant. “He has to—any hour now—his men—”

“No one’s coming,” I said, the words heavier than I’d intended. “This is what we have.”  

Wil swore under his breath. Sim stayed quiet, his fingers brushing the window frame. I could feel his thoughts turn like grinding gears.  

“What do we have left?” he asked, looking to one of the few sober guards.  

The man shrugged. “Oil. Pitch. Mishmash of gear upstairs. No bloody tunnels out, though. Just us. That’s it.”

Sim shot me a glance, his eyes flicking to my shoulder. “You can’t lead like this,” he said bluntly.  

“I’ll manage,” I said, even as black spots danced in my vision.  

“Tehlu’s breath, you can barely stand! Let me help,” Sim snapped, something sharp beneath his usual softness.  

I stepped back, leaning heavily against the wall. My voice came quieter now. “Alright.”

For so long, I had wondered why Sim never truly stepped forward despite all his potential. He’d once told me that his father, the Duke of Daloni, had tried to mold him into a leader—tried and failed. Sim lacked the sharpness of ambition, the hunger for power or control. Kind-hearted people don’t seize the reins. They shy from them.

But perhaps his father had been right to hope after all. Perhaps leadership didn’t always come from hunger. Sometimes it came from necessity. 

Sim squared his shoulders, his mouth tightening into a line I recognized—not nervous, for once, but resolute. “Wil, start bringing the oil down. Focus on the murderholes first.” He turned to the guards, his voice firm enough to cut through their haze. “You two—secure anything sharp. Swords, arrows, godsdamned chair legs if you have to. Bring them all here.”

To my surprise, the men obeyed. Sim’s words carried weight now.  

Outside, Fascino began his ultimatum, his smooth voice rising like venom on the wind. “Surrender the King, and the rest of you may leave with your lives. Refuse me, and you’ll see the inside of your bellies before the day is done.”  

The guards shifted nervously, but before doubt could sink teeth into them, Sim raised his voice. “Don’t believe him.” He stepped deeper into the lamplight, his face calm and leveled. “Look outside. Look at the street. Tell me how many of our brothers and sisters Fascino left alive. Go ahead. *Count them.*”

The room stilled. Sim let the heavy silence swell.  

“That’s what I thought,” he said. “He doesn’t want mercy. He wants your fear. Don’t give it to him.”  

It was the first time I’d seen him like this, standing not as a faithful companion but as a leader. And for the first time, under the tension fraught canopy of blood and fire, the room stayed steady.  

***

The ram came first.

From the tower, I watched as Fascino’s soldiers surged forward, wielding shields while others carried the massive timber battering ram. Men scrabbled into place, Sim barking orders with a sureness that felt foreign on his lips but suited him just the same.  

Roderick’s voice boomed from behind. “For Vintas! Hold the fort, men!”

Even in the chaos, I bitterly noted that his stolen valor sounded hollow. But there was no time for anger. As the ram crossed the bridge, Sim called: “Loose!”

Arrows struck the unshielded front ranks. Soldiers fell, their weight pitching the ram awkwardly into the ground. But more came to replace them. Behind the first ranks, shield bearers pressed forward, and the battered gate shuddered under repeated blows.

The tower groaned, dust creeping from the crevices. I felt the vibrations of each strike in my bones. “Ready the cauldron!” Sim shouted, rushing to help the others maneuver the boiling oil into position.

“Now!” The cauldron tipped. The ram crew below screamed as liquid fire poured over them, and bottles of dreg followed. The courtyard lit up, and Fascino’s soldiers scattered like startled insects.

For a moment, hope flickered. Then I saw the mangonel.
